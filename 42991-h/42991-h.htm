<p class="xd21e460"><span class="xd21e460init">I</span>n 1894, equipped
with a set of anthropometric instruments obtained on loan from the
Asiatic Society of Bengal, I commenced an investigation of the tribes
of the N&#299;lgiri hills, the Todas, Kotas, and Badagas, bringing down
on myself the unofficial criticism that &ldquo;anthropological research
at high altitudes is eminently indicated when the thermometer registers
100&deg; in Madras.&rdquo; From this modest beginning have
resulted:&mdash;(1) investigation of various classes which inhabit the
city of Madras; (2) periodical tours to various parts of the Madras
Presidency, with a view to the study of the more important tribes and
classes; (3) the publication of Bulletins, wherein the results of my
work are embodied; (4) the establishment of an anthropological
laboratory; (5) a collection of photographs of Native types; (6) a
series of lantern slides for lecture purposes; (7) a collection of
phonograph records of tribal songs and music.</p>
<p>The scheme for a systematic and detailed ethnographic survey of the
whole of India received the formal sanction of the Government of India
in 1901. A Superintendent of Ethnography was appointed for each
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e464" href="#xd21e464" name=
"xd21e464">x</a>]</span>Presidency or Province, to carry out the work
of the survey in addition to his other duties. The other duty, in my
particular case&mdash;the direction of a large local
museum&mdash;happily made an excellent blend with the survey
operations, as the work of collection for the ethnological section went
on simultaneously with that of investigation. The survey was financed
for a period of five (afterwards extended to eight) years, and an
annual allotment of Rs. 5,000 provided for each Presidency and
Province. This included Rs. 2,000 for approved notes on monographs, and
replies to the stereotyped series of questions. The replies to these
questions were not, I am bound to admit, always entirely satisfactory,
as they broke down both in accuracy and detail. I may, as an
illustration, cite the following description of making fire by
friction. &ldquo;They know how to make fire, <i>i.e.</i>, by friction
of wood as well as stone, etc. They take a triangular cut of stone, and
one flat oblong size flat. They hit one another with the maintenance of
cocoanut fibre or copper, then fire sets immediately, and also by
rubbing the two barks frequently with each other they make
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gladly place on record my hearty appreciation of the services
rendered by Mr. K. Rangachari in the preparation of the present
volumes. During my temporary absence in Europe, he was placed in charge
of the survey, and he has been throughout invaluable in obtaining
information concerning manners and customs, as interpreter and
photographer, and in taking phonograph records. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e471" href="#xd21e471" name=

<p>For information relating to the tribes and castes of Cochin and
Travancore, I gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to Messrs. L. K.
Anantha Krishna Aiyer and N. Subramani Aiyer, the Superintendents of
Ethnography for their respective States. The notes relating to the
Cochin State have been independently published at the Ernakulam Press,
Cochin.</p>
<p>In the scheme for the Ethnographic Survey, it was laid down that the
Superintendents should supplement the information obtained from
representative men and by their own enquiries by &ldquo;researches into
the considerable mass of information which lies buried in official
reports, in the journals of learned Societies, and in various
books.&rdquo; Of this injunction full advantage has been taken, as will
be evident from the abundant crop of references in foot-notes.</p>
<p>It is impossible to express my thanks individually to the very large
number of correspondents, European and Indian, who have generously
assisted me in my work. I may, however, refer to the immense aid which
I have received from the District Manuals edited by Mr. (now Sir) H. A.
Stuart, I.C.S., and the District Gazetteers, which have been quite
recently issued under the editorship of Mr. W. Francis, I.C.S., Mr. F.
R. Hemingway, I.C.S., and Mr. F. B. Evans, I.C.S.</p>
<p>My thanks are further due to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao, to whom I am
indebted for much information acquired when he was engaged in the
preparation of the District Gazetteers, and for revising the proof
sheets. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e480" href="#xd21e480" name=

<p>For some of the photographs of Badagas, Kurumbas, and Todas, I am
indebted to Mr. A. T. W. Penn of Ootacamund.</p>
<p>I may add that the anthropometric data are all the result of
measurements taken by myself, in order to eliminate the varying error
resulting from the employment of a plurality of observers.</p>

country, over which my investigations in connection with the
ethnographic survey of South India have extended, is commonly known as
the Madras Presidency, and officially as the Presidency of Fort St.

States of Puduk&#333;ttai, Banganapalle, and Sand&#363;r, and the
larger Native States of Travancore and Cochin. The area of the British
territory and Feudatory States, as returned at the census, 1901, was
143,221 square miles, and the population 38,623,066. The area and

<p>Briefly, the task which was set me in 1901 was to record the
&lsquo;manners and customs&rsquo; and physical characters of more than
300 castes and tribes, representing more than 40,000,000 individuals,
and spread over an area exceeding 150,000 square miles.</p>
<p>The Native State of Mysore, which is surrounded by the Madras
Presidency on all sides, except on part of the west, where the Bombay
Presidency forms the boundary, was excluded from my beat
ethnographically, but included for the purpose of anthropometry. As,
however, nearly all the castes and tribes which inhabit the Mysore
State are common to it and the Madras <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e524" href="#xd21e524" name="xd21e524">xiv</a>]</span>Presidency,
I have given here and there some information relating thereto.</p>
<p>It was clearly impossible for myself and my assistant, in our
travels, to do more than carry out personal investigations over a small
portion of the vast area indicated above, which provides ample scope
for research by many trained explorers. And I would that more men, like
my friends Dr. Rivers and Mr. Lapicque, who have recently studied Man
in Southern India from an anthropological and physiological point of
view, would come out on a visit, and study some of the more important
castes and tribes in detail. I can promise them every facility for
carrying out their work under the most favourable conditions for
research, if not of climate. And we can provide them with anything from
112&deg; in the shade to the sweet half English air of the N&#299;lgiri
and other hill-ranges.</p>
<p>Routine work at head-quarters unhappily keeps me a close prisoner in
the office chair for nine months in the year. But I have endeavoured to
snatch three months on circuit in camp, during which the dual functions
of the survey&mdash;the collection of ethnographic and anthropometric
data&mdash;were carried out in the peaceful isolation of the jungle, in
villages, and in mofussil (up-country) towns. These wandering
expeditions have afforded ample evidence that delay in carrying through
the scheme for the survey would have been fatal. For, as in the Pacific
and other regions, so in India, civilisation is bringing about a
radical change in indigenous manners and customs, and mode of life. It
has, in this connection, been well said that &ldquo;there will be
plenty of money and people available for anthropological research, when
there are no more aborigines. And it behoves our museums to waste no
time in completing their anthropological <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e530" href="#xd21e530" name=
"xd21e530">xv</a>]</span>collections.&rdquo; Tribes which, only a few
years ago, were living in a wild state, clad in a cool and simple garb
of forest leaves, buried away in the depths of the jungle, and living,
like pigs and bears, on roots, honey, and other forest produce, have
now come under the domesticating, and sometimes detrimental influence
of contact with Europeans, with a resulting modification of their
conditions of life, morality, and even language. The Paniyans of the
Wynaad, and the Irulas of the N&#299;lgiris, now work regularly for
wages on planters&rsquo; estates, and I have seen a Toda boy studying
for the third standard instead of tending the buffaloes of his mand. A
Toda lassie curling her ringlets with the assistance of a cheap German
looking-glass; a Toda man smeared with Hindu sect marks, and praying
for male offspring at a Hindu shrine; the abandonment of leafy garments
in favour of imported cotton piece-goods; the employment of kerosine
tins in lieu of thatch; the decline of the national turban in favour of
the less becoming pork-pie cap or knitted nightcap of gaudy hue; the
abandonment of indigenous vegetable dyes in favour of tinned anilin and
alizarin dyes; the replacement of the indigenous peasant jewellery by
imported beads and imitation jewellery made in Europe&mdash;these are a
few examples of change resulting from Western and other influences.</p>
<p>The practice of human sacrifice, or Meriah rite, has been abolished
within the memory of men still living, and replaced by the equally
efficacious slaughter of a buffalo or sheep. And I have notes on a
substituted ceremony, in which a sacrificial sheep is shaved so as to
produce a crude representation of a human being, a Hindu sect mark
painted on its forehead, a turban stuck on its head, and a cloth around
its body. The picturesque, but barbaric ceremony of hook-swinging is
now <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e534" href="#xd21e534" name=
"xd21e534">xvi</a>]</span>regarded with disfavour by Government, and,
some time ago, I witnessed a tame substitute for the original ceremony,
in which, instead of a human being with strong iron hooks driven
through the small of his back, a little wooden figure, dressed up in
turban and body cloth, and carrying a shield and sabre, was hoisted on
high and swung round.</p>
<p>In carrying out the anthropometric portion of the survey, it was
unfortunately impossible to disguise the fact that I am a Government
official, and very considerable difficulties were encountered owing to
the wickedness of the people, and their timidity and fear of increased
taxation, plague inoculation, and transportation. The Paniyan women of
the Wynaad believed that I was going to have the finest specimens among
them stuffed for the Madras Museum. An Irula man, on the N&#299;lgiri
hills, who was wanted by the police for some mild crime of ancient
date, came to be measured, but absolutely refused to submit to the
operation on the plea that the height-measuring standard was the
gallows. The similarity of the word Boyan to Boer was once fatal to my
work. For, at the time of my visit to the Odd&#275;s, who have Boyan as
their title, the South African war was just over, and they were afraid
that I was going to get them transported, to replace the Boers who had
been exterminated. Being afraid, too, of my evil eye, they refused to
fire a new kiln of bricks for the club chambers at Coimbatore until I
had taken my departure. During a long tour through the Mysore province,
the Natives mistook me for a recruiting sergeant bent on seizing them
for employment in South Africa, and fled before my approach from town
to town. The little spot, which I am in the habit of making with
Aspinall&rsquo;s white paint to indicate the position of the
fronto-nasal suture and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e538" href=
"#xd21e538" name="xd21e538">xvii</a>]</span>bi-orbital breadth, was
supposed to possess vesicant properties, and to blister into a number
on the forehead, which would serve as a means of future identification
for the purpose of kidnapping. The record of head, chest, and foot
measurements, was viewed with marked suspicion, on the ground that I
was an army tailor, measuring for sepoy&rsquo;s clothing. The untimely
death of a Native outside a town, at which I was halting, was
attributed to my evil eye. Villages were denuded of all save senile
men, women, and infants. The vendors of food-stuffs in one bazar,
finding business slack owing to the flight of their customers, raised
their prices, and a missionary complained that the price of butter had
gone up. My arrival at one important town was coincident with a great
annual temple festival, whereat there were not sufficient coolies left
to drag the temple car in procession. So I had perforce to move on, and
leave the Br&#257;hman heads unmeasured. The head official of another
town, when he came to take leave of me, apologised for the scrubby
appearance of his chin, as the local barber had fled. One man, who had
volunteered to be tested with Lovibond&rsquo;s tintometer, was suddenly
seized with fear in the midst of the experiment, and, throwing his
body-cloth at my feet, ran for all he was worth, and disappeared. An
elderly Municipal servant wept bitterly when undergoing the process of
measurement, and a woman bade farewell to her husband, as she thought
for ever, as he entered the threshold of my impromptu laboratory. The
goniometer for estimating the facial angle is specially hated, as it
goes into the mouth of castes both high and low, and has to be taken to
a tank (pond) after each application. The members of a certain caste
insisted on being measured before 4 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, so
that they might have time to remove, by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e543" href="#xd21e543" name="xd21e543">xviii</a>]</span>ceremonial
ablution, the pollution from my touch before sunset.</p>
<p>Such are a few of the unhappy results, which attend the progress of
a Government anthropologist. I may, when in camp, so far as measuring
operations are concerned, draw a perfect and absolute blank for several
days in succession, or a gang of fifty or even more representatives of
different castes may turn up at the same time, all in a hurry to depart
as soon as they have been sufficiently amused by the phonograph,
American series of pseudoptics (illusions), and hand dynamometer, which
always accompany me on my travels as an attractive bait. When this
occurs, it is manifestly impossible to record all the major, or any of
the minor measurements, which are prescribed in &lsquo;Anthropological
Notes and Queries,&rsquo; and elsewhere. And I have to rest unwillingly
content with a bare record of those measurements, which experience has
taught me are the most important from a comparative point of view
within my area, viz., stature, height and breadth of nose, and length
and breadth of head, from which the nasal and cephalic indices can be
calculated. I refer to the practical difficulties, in explanation of a
record which is admittedly meagre, but wholly unavoidable, in spite of
the possession of a good deal of patience and a liberal supply of
cheroots, and current coins, which are often regarded with suspicion as
sealing a contract, like the King&rsquo;s shilling. I have even known a
man get rid of the coin presented to him, by offering it, with flowers
and a cocoanut, to the village goddess at her shrine, and present her
with another coin as a peace-offering, to get rid of the pollution
created by my money.</p>
<p>The manifold views, which have been brought forward as to the origin
and place in nature of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e549"
href="#xd21e549" name="xd21e549">xix</a>]</span>indigenous population
of Southern India, are scattered so widely in books, manuals, and
reports, that it will be convenient if I bring together the evidence
derived from sundry sources.</p>
<p>The original name for the Dravidian family, it may be noted, was
Tamulic, but the term Dravidian was substituted by Bishop Caldwell, in
order that the designation Tamil might be reserved for the language of
that name. Dr&#257;vida is the adjectival form of Dravida, the Sanskrit
name for the people occupying the south of the Indian Peninsula (the
Deccan of some European writers).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e553src"
href="#xd21e553" name="xd21e553src">1</a></p>
<p>According to Haeckel,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e559src" href=
"#xd21e559" name="xd21e559src">2</a> three of the twelve species of
man&mdash;the Dravidas (Deccans; Sinhalese), Nubians, and Mediterranese
(Caucasians, Basque, Semites, Indo-Germanic tribes)&mdash;&ldquo;agree
in several characteristics, which seem to establish a close
relationship between them, and to distinguish them from the remaining
species. The chief of these characteristics is the strong development
of the beard which, in all other species, is either entirely wanting,
or but very scanty. The hair of their heads is in most cases more or
less curly. Other characteristics also seem to favour our classing them
in one main group of curly-haired men (Euplocomi); at present the
prim&aelig;val species, Homo Dravida, is only represented by the Deccan
tribes in the southern part of Hindustan, and by the neighbouring
inhabitants of the mountains on the north-east of Ceylon. But, in
earlier times, this race seems to have occupied the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e562" href="#xd21e562" name=
"xd21e562">xx</a>]</span>whole of Hindustan, and to have spread even
further. It shows, on the one hand, traits of relationship to the
Australians and Malays; on the other to the Mongols and Mediterranese.
Their skin is either of a light or dark brown colour; in some tribes,
of a yellowish brown. The hair of their heads is, as in Mediterranese,
more or less curled; never quite smooth, like that of the Euthycomi,
nor actually woolly, like that of the Ulotrichi. The strong development
of the beard is also like that of the Mediterranese. Their forehead is
generally high, their nose prominent and narrow, their lips slightly
protruding. Their language is now very much mixed with Indo-Germanic
elements, but seems to have been originally derived from a very
prim&aelig;val language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the chapter devoted to &lsquo;Migration and Distribution of
Organisms,&rsquo; Haeckel, in referring to the continual changing of
the distribution of land and water on the surface of the earth, says:
&ldquo;The Indian Ocean formed a continent, which extended from the
Sunda Islands along the southern coast of Asia to the east coast of
Africa. This large continent of former times Sclater has called
Lemuria, from the monkey-like animals which inhabited it, and it is at
the same time of great importance from being the probable cradle of the
human race. The important proof which Wallace has furnished by the help
of chronological facts, that the present Malayan Archipelago consists
in reality of two completely different divisions, is particularly
interesting. The western division, the Indo-Malayan Archipelago,
comprising the large islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra, was formerly
connected by Malacca with the Asiatic continent, and probably also with
the Lemurian continent, and probably also with the Lemurian continent
just mentioned. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e566" href=
"#xd21e566" name="xd21e566">xxi</a>]</span>The eastern division, on the
other hand, the Austro-Malayan Archipelago, comprising Celebes, the
Moluccas, New Guinea, Solomon&rsquo;s Islands, etc., was formerly
directly connected with Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An important ethnographic fact, and one which is significant, is
that the description of tree-climbing by the Dyaks of Borneo, as given
by Wallace,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e570src" href="#xd21e570" name=
"xd21e570src">3</a> might have been written on the Anaimalai hills of
Southern India, and would apply equally well in every detail to the
K&#257;dirs who inhabit those hills.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e573src"
href="#xd21e573" name="xd21e573src">4</a> An interesting custom, which
prevails among the K&#257;dirs and Mala V&#275;dans of Travancore, and
among them alone, so far as I know, in the Indian Peninsula, is that of
chipping all or some of the incisor teeth into the form of a sharp
pointed, but not serrated, cone. The operation is said to be performed,
among the K&#257;dirs, with a chisel or bill-hook and file, on boys at
the age of eighteen, and girls at the age of ten or thereabouts. It is
noted by Skeat and Blagden<a class="noteref" id="xd21e578src" href=
"#xd21e578" name="xd21e578src">5</a> that the Jakuns of the Malay
Peninsula are accustomed to file their teeth to a point. Mr. Crawford
tells us further that, in the Malay Archipelago, the practice of filing
and blackening the teeth is a necessary prelude to marriage, the common
way of expressing the fact that a girl has arrived at puberty being
that she had her teeth filed. In an article<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e581src" href="#xd21e581" name="xd21e581src">6</a> entitled
&ldquo;Die Zauberbilderschriften der Negrito in Malaka,&rdquo; Dr. K.
T. Preuss describes in detail the designs on the bamboo combs, etc., of
the Negritos of Malacca, and compares them with the strikingly similar
designs on the bamboo combs worn by the K&#257;dirs of Southern India.
He works out in detail the theory that the design is not, as I called
it<a class="noteref" id="xd21e584src" href="#xd21e584" name=
"xd21e584src">7</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e588" href=
"#xd21e588" name="xd21e588">xxii</a>]</span>an ornamental geometric
pattern, but consists of a series of hieroglyphics. It is noted by
Skeat and Blagden<a class="noteref" id="n15asrc" href="#n15a" name=
"n15asrc">8</a> that &ldquo;the Semang women wore in their hair a
remarkable kind of comb, which appears to be worn entirely as a charm
against diseases. These combs were almost invariably made of bamboo,
and were decorated with an infinity of designs, no two of which ever
entirely agreed. It was said that each disease had its appropriate
pattern. Similar combs are worn by the Pangan, the Semang and Sakai of
Perak, and most of the mixed (Semang-Sakai) tribes.&rdquo; I am
informed by Mr. Vincent that, as far as he knows, the K&#257;dir combs
are not looked on as charms, and the markings thereon have no mystic
significance. A K&#257;dir man should always make a comb, and present
it to his wife just before marriage or at the conclusion of the
marriage ceremony, and the young men vie with each other as to who can
make the nicest comb. Sometimes they represent strange articles on the
combs. Mr. Vincent has, for example, seen a comb with a very good
imitation of the face of a clock scratched on it.</p>
<p>In discussing the racial affinities of the Sakais, Skeat and Blagden
write<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n15a">8</a> that &ldquo;an
alternative theory comes to us on the high authority of Virchow, who
puts it forward, however, in a somewhat tentative manner. It consists
in regarding the Sakai as an outlying branch of a racial group formed
by the Vedda (of Ceylon), Tamil, Kurumba, and Australian races.... Of
these the height is variable, but, in all four of the races compared,
it is certainly greater than that of the Negrito races. The skin
colour, again, it is true, varies to a remarkable degree, but the
general hair character appears to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e599" href="#xd21e599" name="xd21e599">xxiii</a>]</span>uniformly
long, black and wavy, and the skull-index, on the other hand, appears
to indicate consistently a dolichocephalic or long-shaped head.&rdquo;
Speaking of the Sakais, the same authorities state that &ldquo;in
evidence of their striking resemblance to the Veddas, it is perhaps
worth remarking that one of the brothers Sarasin who had lived among
the Veddas and knew them very well, when shown a photograph of a
typical Sakai, at first supposed it to be a photograph of a
Vedda.&rdquo; For myself, when I first saw the photographs of Sakais
published by Skeat and Blagden, it was difficult to realise that I was
not looking at pictures of K&#257;dirs, Paniyans, Kurumbas, or other
jungle folk of Southern India.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The name Kling (or Keling) is applied, in the Malay
countries, to the people of Continental India who trade thither, or are
settled in those regions, and to the descendants of settlers. The Malay
use of the word is, as a rule, restricted to Tamils. The name is a form
of Kalinga, a very ancient name for the region known as the Northern
Circars, <i>i.e.</i>, the Telugu coast of the Bay of
Bengal.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e663src" href="#xd21e663"

informs us<a class="noteref" id="xd21e671src" href="#xd21e671" name=

coast, there are &ldquo;certain men who make a livelihood by shooting
pigeons with blow-guns. According to my Labbai informants, the
&lsquo;guns&rsquo; are purchased by them in Singapore from Bugis
traders. There is still a considerable trade, although diminished,
between Kilakarai and the ports of Burma and the Straits Settlements.
It is carried on entirely by Muhammadans in native sailing vessels, and
a large proportion of the Musalmans of Kilakarai have visited Penang
and Singapore. It is not difficult to find among them men who can speak
Straits Malay. The local name for the blow-gun is sengutt&#257;n, and
is derived in popular etymology from the Tamil sen (above) and kutu (to
stab). I have little doubt that it is really a corruption of the Malay
name of the weapon sumpitan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the evidence of the very close affinities between the plants and
animals in Africa and India at a very remote period, Mr. R. D. Oldham
concludes that there was once a continuous stretch of dry land
connecting South Africa and India. &ldquo;In some deposits,&rdquo; he
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e676src" href="#xd21e676" name=
"xd21e676src">11</a> &ldquo;found resting upon the Karoo beds on the
coast of Natal, 22 out of 35 species of Mollusca and Echinodermata
collected and specifically identified, are identical with forms found
in the cretaceous beds of Southern India, the majority being
Trichinopoly species. From the cretaceous rocks of Madagascar, six
species of cretaceous fossils were examined by Mr. R. B. Newton in
1899, of which three are also found in the Ariyalur group (Southern
India). The South African beds are clearly coast or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e679" href="#xd21e679" name=
"xd21e679">xxv</a>]</span>shallow water deposits, like those of India.
The great similarity of forms certainly suggests continuity of coast
line between the two regions, and thus supports the view that the land
connection between South Africa and India, already shown to have
existed in both the lower and upper Gondw&aacute;na periods, was
continued into cretaceous times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am unable to subscribe to the prognathism of the Dravidian tribes
of Southern India, or of the jungle people, though aberrant examples
thereof are contained in the collection of skulls at the Madras Museum,
<i>e.g.</i>, the skull of a Tamil man (caste unknown) who died a few
years ago in Madras (Pl. I-<i>a</i>). The average facial angle of
various castes and tribes which I have examined ranged between 67&deg;
and 70&deg;, and the inhabitants of Southern India may be classified as
orthognathous. Some of the large earthenware urns excavated by Mr. A.
Rea, of the Arch&aelig;ological Department, at the
&ldquo;prehistoric&rdquo; burial site at Aditanall&#363;r in the
Tinnevelly district,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e779src" href=

"#xd21e904" name="xd21e904src">15</a> a white division of man, called
the Caucasian or Eurafrican, is made to include Huxley&rsquo;s
Xanthochroi (blonde type) and Melanochroi (black hair and eyes, and
skin of almost all shades from white to black). The Melanochroi are
said to &ldquo;comprise the greater majority of the inhabitants of
Southern Europe, North Africa, and South-west Asia, and consist mainly
of the Aryan, Semitic, and Hamitic families. The Dravidians of India,
the Veddahs of Ceylon, and probably the Ainus of Japan, and the Maoutze
of China, also belong to this race, which may have contributed
something to the mixed character of some tribes of Indo-China and the
Polynesian islands, and have given at least the characters of the hair
to the otherwise Negroid inhabitants of Australia. In Southern India
they are largely mixed with a Negrito element, and, in Africa, where
their habitat becomes coterminous with that of the Negroes, numerous
cross-races have sprung up between them all along the frontier
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In describing the &ldquo;Hindu type,&rdquo; Topinard<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e909src" href="#xd21e909" name="xd21e909src">16</a>
divides the population of the Indian peninsula into three strata, viz.,
the Black, Mongolian, and the Aryan. &ldquo;The remnants of the
first,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are at the present time <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e912" href="#xd21e912" name=
"xd21e912">xxviii</a>]</span>shut up in the mountains of Central India
under the name of Bhils, Mahairs, Ghonds, and Khonds; and in the south
under that of Yen&#257;dis, Kurumbas, etc. Its primitive characters,
apart from its black colour and low stature, are difficult to discover,
but it is to be noticed that travellers do not speak of woolly hair in
India.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e914src" href="#xd21e914" name=
"xd21e914src">17</a> The second has spread over the plateaux of Central
India by two lines of way, one to the north-east, the other to the
north-west. The remnants of the first invasion are seen in the
Dravidian or Tamil tribes, and those of the second in the Jhats. The
third more recent, and more important as to quality than as to number,
was the Aryan.&rdquo; In speaking further of the Australian type,
characterised by a combination of smooth hair with Negroid features,
Topinard states that &ldquo;it is clear that the Australians might very
well be the result of the cross between one race with smooth hair from
some other place, and a really Negro and autochthonous race. The
opinions held by Huxley are in harmony with this hypothesis. He says
the Australians are identical with the ancient inhabitants of the
Deccan. The features of the present blacks in India, and the characters
which the Dravidian and Australian languages have in common, tend to
assimilate them. The existence of the boomerang in the two countries,
and some remnants of caste in Australia, help to support the
opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e918width" id="pl0-028"><img src=
"images/pl0-028.jpg" alt="South Indian boomerangs." width="720" height=
"513">
<p class="figureHead">South Indian boomerangs.</p>
</div>
<p>Of the so-called boomerangs of Southern India, the Madras Museum
possesses three (two ivory, one wooden) from the Tanjore armoury
(<a href="#pl0-028">Pl. II</a>). Concerning them, the Dew&#257;n of
Pudukk&#333;ttai writes to me as follows. &ldquo;The valari or valai
tadi (bent stick) is a short weapon, generally made of some
hard-grained wood. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e927" href=
"#xd21e927" name="xd21e927">xxix</a>]</span>It is also sometimes made
of iron. It is crescent-shaped, one end being heavier than the other,
and the outer end is sharpened. Men trained in the use of the weapon
hold it by the lighter end, whirl it a few times over their shoulders
to give it impetus, and then hurl it with great force against the
object aimed at. It is said that there were experts in the art of
throwing the valari, who could at one stroke despatch small game, and
even man. No such experts are now forthcoming in the Pudukk&#333;ttai
State, though the instrument is reported to be occasionally used in
hunting hares, jungle fowl, etc. Its days, however, must be counted as
past. Tradition states that the instrument played a considerable part
in the Poligar wars of the last century. But it now reposes peacefully
in the households of the descendants of the rude Kallan and Maravan
warriors, preserved as a sacred relic of a chivalric past, along with
other old family weapons in their p&#363;ja (worship) room, brought out
and scraped and cleaned on occasions like the Ayudha p&#363;ja day
(when worship is paid to weapons and implements of industry), and
restored to its place of rest immediately afterwards.&rdquo; At a
Kallan marriage, the bride and bridegroom go to the house of the
latter, where boomerangs are exchanged, and a feast is held. This
custom appears to be fast becoming a tradition. But there is a common
saying still current &ldquo;Send the valai tadi, and bring the
bride.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e929src" href="#xd21e929" name=
"xd21e929src">18</a></p>
<p>It is pointed out by Topinard,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e936src"
href="#xd21e936" name="xd21e936src">19</a> as a somewhat important
piece of evidence, that, in the West, about Madagascar and the point of
Aden in Africa, there are black tribes with smooth hair, or, at all
events, large numbers of individuals who have it, mingled particularly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e940" href="#xd21e940" name=
"xd21e940">xxx</a>]</span>among the Som&#257;lis and the Gallas, in the
region where M. Broca has an idea that some dark, and not Negro, race,
now extinct, once existed. At the meeting of the British Association,
1898, Mr. W. Crooke gave expression to the view that the Dravidians
represent an emigration from the African continent, and discounted the
theory that the Aryans drove the aboriginal inhabitants into the
jungles with the suggestion that the Aryan invasion was more social
than racial, viz., that what India borrowed from the Aryans was manners
and customs. According to this view, it must have been reforming
aborigines who gained the ascendancy in India, rather than new-comers;
and those of the aborigines who clung to their old ways got left behind
in the struggle for existence.</p>
<p>In an article devoted to the Australians, Professor R. Semon writes
as follows. &ldquo;We must, without hesitation, presume that the
ancestors of the Australians stood, at the time of their immigration to
the continent, on a lower rung of culture than their living
representatives of to-day. Whence, and in what manner, the immigration
took place, it is difficult to determine. In the neighbouring quarter
of the globe there lives no race, which is closely related to the
Australians. Their nearest neighbours, the Papuans of New Guinea, the
Malays of the Sunda Islands, and the Macris of New Zealand, stand in no
close relationship to them. On the other hand, we find further away,
among the Dravidian aborigines of India, types which remind us forcibly
of the Australians in their anthropological characters. In drawing
attention to the resemblance of the hill-tribes of the Deccan to the
Australians, Huxley says: &lsquo;An ordinary cooly, such as one can see
among the sailors of any newly-arrived East India vessel, would, if
stripped, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e944" href="#xd21e944"
name="xd21e944">xxxi</a>]</span>pass very well for an Australian,
although the skull and lower jaw are generally less coarse.&rsquo;
Huxley here goes a little too far in his accentuation of the similarity
of type. We are, however, undoubtedly confronted with a number of
characters&mdash;skull formation, features, wavy curled hair&mdash;in
common between the Australians and Dravidians, which gain in importance
from the fact that, by the researches of Norris, Bleek, and Caldwell, a
number of points of resemblance between the Australian and Dravidian
languages have been discovered, and this despite the fact that the
homes of the two races are so far apart, and that a number of races are
wedged in between them, whose languages have no relationship whatever
to either the Dravidian or Australian. There is much that speaks in
favour of the view that the Australians and Dravidians sprang from a
common main branch of the human race. According to the laborious
researches of Paul and Fritz Sarasin, the Veddas of Ceylon, whom one
might call pre-Dravidians, would represent an off-shoot from this main
stem. When they branched off, they stood on a very low rung of
development, and seem to have made hardly any progress worth
mentioning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In dealing with the Australian problem, Mr. A. H. Keane<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e948src" href="#xd21e948" name="xd21e948src">20</a>
refers to the time when Australia formed almost continuous land with
the African continent, and to its accessibility on the north and
north-west to primitive migration both from India and Papuasia.
&ldquo;That such migrations,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;took place,
scarcely admits of a doubt, and the Rev. John Mathew<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e951src" href="#xd21e951" name="xd21e951src">21</a> concludes
that the continent was first occupied by a homogeneous branch of the
Papuan race either from New Guinea or Malaysia, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e954" href="#xd21e954" name=
"xd21e954">xxxii</a>]</span>and that these first arrivals, to be
regarded as true aborigines, passed into Tasmania, which at that time
probably formed continuous land with Australia. Thus the now extinct
Tasmanians would represent the primitive type, which, in Australia,
became modified, but not effaced, by crossing with later immigrants,
chiefly from India. These are identified, as they have been by other
ethnologists, with the Dravidians, and the writer remarks that
&lsquo;although the Australians are still in a state of savagery, and
the Dravidians of India have been for many ages a people civilized in a
great measure, and possessed of literature, the two peoples are
affiliated by deeply-marked characteristics in their social system as
shown by the boomerang, which, unless locally evolved, must have been
introduced from India.&rsquo; But the variations in the physical
characters of the natives appear to be too great to be accounted for by
a single graft; hence Malays also are introduced from the Eastern
Archipelago, which would explain both the straight hair in many
districts, and a number of pure Malay words in several of the native
languages.&rdquo; Dealing later with the ethnical relations of the
Dravidas, Mr. Keane says that &ldquo;although they preceded the
Aryan-speaking Hindus, they are not the true aborigines of the Deccan,
for they were themselves preceded by dark peoples, probably of aberrant
<span class="corr" id="xd21e956" title="Source: Negrite">Negrito</span>
type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the &lsquo;Manual of Administration of the Madras
Presidency,&rsquo; Dr. C. Macleane writes as follows. &ldquo;The
history proper of the south of India may be held to begin with the
Hindu dynasties formed by a more or less intimate admixture of the
Aryan and Dravidian systems of government. But, prior to that, three
stages of historical knowledge are recognisable; first, as to such
aboriginal period as there may have been prior <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e961" href="#xd21e961" name=
"xd21e961">xxxiii</a>]</span>to the Dravidian; secondly, as to the
period when the Aryans had begun to impose their religion and customs
upon the Dravidians, but the time indicated by the early dynasties had
not yet been reached. Geology and natural history alike make it certain
that, at a time within the bounds of human knowledge, Southern India
did not form part of Asia. A large southern continent, of which this
country once formed part, has ever been assumed as necessary to account
for the different circumstances. The Sanscrit Pooranic writers, the
Ceylon Boodhists, and the local traditions of the west coast, all
indicate a great disturbance of the point of the Peninsula and Ceylon
within recent times.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e963src" href=
"#xd21e963" name="xd21e963src">22</a> Investigations in relation to
race show it to be by no means impossible that Southern India was once
the passage-ground, by which the ancient progenitors of Northern and
Mediterranean races proceeded to the parts of the globe which they now
inhabit. In this part of the world, as in others, antiquarian remains
show the existence of peoples who used successively implements of
unwrought stone, of wrought stone, and of metal fashioned in the most
primitive manner.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e966src" href="#xd21e966"
name="xd21e966src">23</a> These tribes have also left cairns and stone
circles indicating burial places. It has been usual to set these down
as earlier than Dravidian. But the hill Coorumbar of the Palmanair
plateau, who are only a detached portion of the oldest known Tamulian
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e971" href="#xd21e971" name=
"xd21e971">xxxiv</a>]</span>population, erect dolmens to this day. The
sepulchral urns of Tinnevelly may be earlier than Dravidian, or they
may be Dravidian.... The evidence of the grammatical structure of
language is to be relied on as a clearly distinctive mark of a
population, but, from this point of view, it appears that there are
more signs of the great lapse of time than of previous populations. The
grammar of the South of India is exclusively Dravidian, and bears no
trace of ever having been anything else. The hill, forest, and Pariah
tribes use the Dravidian forms of grammar and inflection.... The
Dravidians, a very primeval race, take a by no means low place in the
conjectural history of humanity. They have affinities with the
Australian aborigines, which would probably connect their earliest
origin with that people.&rdquo; Adopting a novel classification, Dr.
Macleane, in assuming that there are no living representatives in
Southern India of any race of a wholly pre-Dravidian character,
sub-divides the Dravidians into pre-Tamulian and Tamulian, to designate
two branches of the same family, one older or less civilised than the
other.</p>
<p>The importance, which has been attached by many authorities to the
theory of the connection between the Dravidians and Australians, is
made very clear from the passages in their writings, which I have
quoted. Before leaving this subject, I may appropriately cite as an
important witness Sir William Turner, who has studied the Dravidians
and Australians from the standpoint of craniology.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e975src" href="#xd21e975" name="xd21e975src">24</a> &ldquo;Many
ethnologists of great eminence,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;have regarded
the aborigines of Australia as closely associated with the Dravidians
of India. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e978" href="#xd21e978"
name="xd21e978">xxxv</a>]</span>Some also consider the Dravidians to be
a branch of the great Caucasian stock, and affiliated therefore to
Europeans. If these two hypotheses are to be regarded as sound, a
relationship between the aboriginal Australians and the European would
be established through the Dravidian people of India. The affinities
between the Dravidians and Australians have been based upon the
employment of certain words by both people, apparently derived from
common roots; by the use of the boomerang, similar to the well-known
Australian weapon, by some Dravidian tribes; by the Indian peninsula
having possibly had in a previous geologic epoch a land connection with
the Austro-Malayan Archipelago, and by certain correspondences in the
physical type of the two people. Both Dravidians and Australians have
dark skins approximating to black; dark eyes; black hair, either
straight, wavy or curly, but not woolly or frizzly; thick lips; low
nose with wide nostrils; usually short stature, though the Australians
are somewhat taller than the Dravidians. When the skulls are compared
with each other, whilst they correspond in some particulars, they
differ in others. In both races, the general form and proportions are
dolichocephalic, but in the Australians the crania are absolutely
longer than in the Dravidians, owing in part to the prominence of the
glabella. The Australian skull is heavier, and the outer table is
coarser and rougher than in the Dravidian; the forehead also is much
more receding; the sagittal region is frequently ridged, and the slope
outwards to the parietal eminence is steeper. The Australians in the
<i lang="la">norma facialis</i> have the glabella and supra-orbital
ridges much more projecting; the nasion more depressed; the jaws
heavier; the upper jaw usually prognathous, sometimes remarkably
so.&rdquo; Of twelve Dravidian skulls <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e983" href="#xd21e983" name="xd21e983">xxxvi</a>]</span>measured
by Sir William Turner, in seven the jaw was orthognathous, in four, in
the lower term of the mesognathous series; one specimen only was
prognathic. The customary type of jaw, therefore, was
orthognathic.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e985src" href="#xd21e985" name=
"xd21e985src">25</a> The conclusion at which Sir William Turner arrives
is that &ldquo;by a careful comparison of Australian and Dravidian
crania, there ought not to be much difficulty in distinguishing one
from the other. The comparative study of the characters of the two
series of crania has not led me to the conclusion that they can be
adduced in support of the theory of the unity of the two
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dravidians of Southern India are divided by Sir Herbert
Risley<a class="noteref" id="xd21e990src" href="#xd21e990" name=
"xd21e990src">26</a> into two main groups, the Scytho-Dravidian and the
Dravidian, which he sums up as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Scytho-Dravidian type of Western India, comprising the
Mar&#257;tha Br&#257;ahmans, the Kunbis and the Coorgs; probably formed
by a mixture of Scythian and Dravidian elements, the former
predominating in the higher groups, the latter in the lower. The head
is broad; complexion fair; hair on face rather scanty; stature medium;
nose moderately fine, and not conspicuously long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dravidian type extending from Ceylon to the valley of the
Ganges, and pervading the whole of Madras, Hyderabad, the Central
Provinces, most of Central India, and Chutia N&#257;gpur. Its most
characteristic representatives are the Paniyans of the South Indian
Hills and the Santals of Chutia N&#257;gpur. Probably the original type
of the population of India, now modified to a varying extent by the
admixture of Aryan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e998" href=
"#xd21e998" name="xd21e998">xxxvii</a>]</span>Scythian, and Mongoloid
elements. In typical specimens, the stature is short or below mean; the
complexion very dark, approaching black; hair plentiful with an
occasional tendency to curl; eyes dark; head long; nose very broad,
sometimes depressed at the root, but not so as to make the face appear
flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is, it will be noted, observed by Risley that the head of the
Scytho-Dravidian is broad, and that of the Dravidian long. Writing some
years ago concerning the Dravidian head with reference to a statement
in Taylor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Origin of the Aryans,&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1002src" href="#xd21e1002" name="xd21e1002src">27</a> that
&ldquo;the Todas are fully dolichocephalic, differing in this respect
from the Dravidians, who are brachycephalic,&rdquo; I
published<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1005src" href="#xd21e1005" name=
"xd21e1005src">28</a> certain statistics based on the measurements of a
number of subjects in the southern districts of the Madras Presidency.
These figures showed that &ldquo;the average cephalic index of 639
members of 19 different castes and tribes was 74.1; and that, in only
19 out of the 639 individuals, did the index exceed 80. So far then
from the Dravidian being separated from the Todas by reason of their
higher cephalic index, this index is, in the Todas, actually higher
than in some of the Dravidian peoples.&rdquo; Accustomed as I was, in
my wanderings among the Tamil and Malay&#257;lam folk, to deal with
heads in which the dolichocephalic or sub-dolichocephalic type
preponderates, I was amazed to find, in the course of an expedition in
the Bellary district (in the Canarese area), that the question of the
type of the Dravidian head was not nearly so simple and straightforward
as I had imagined. My records of head measurements now include a very
large series taken in the plains in the Tulu, Canarese, Telugu,
Malay&#257;lam, and Tamil areas, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1008" href="#xd21e1008" name="xd21e1008">xxxviii</a>]</span>the
measurements of a few Maratha (non-Dravidian) classes settled in the
Canarese country. In the following tabular statement, I have brought
together, for the purpose of comparison, the records of the
head-measurements of representative classes in each of these
areas:&mdash;</p>

<p>These tables not only bring out the difference in the cephalic index
of the classes selected as representative of the different areas, but
further show that there is a greater constancy in the Tamil and
Malay&#257;lam classes than in the Tulus, Canarese and Telugus. The
number of individuals clustering round the average is conspicuously
greater in the two former than in the three latter. I am not prepared
to hazard any new theory to account for the marked difference in the
type of cranium in the various areas under consideration, and must
content myself with the observation that, whatever may have been the
influence which has brought about the existing sub-brachycephalic or
mesaticephalic type in the northern areas, this influence has not
extended southward into the Tamil and Malay&#257;lam countries, where
Dravidian man remains dolicho- or sub-dolichocephalic.</p>
<p>As an excellent example of constancy of type in the cephalic index,
I may cite, <i lang="fr">en passant</i>, the following <span class=

<p>Taking the evidence of the figures, they demonstrate that, like the
other classes which have been analysed, the Br&#257;hmans have a higher
cephalic index, with a wider range, in the northern than in the
southern area.</p>
<p>There is a tradition that the Shivalli Br&#257;hmans of the Tulu
country came from Ahikshetra. As only males migrated from their home,
they were compelled to take women from non-Br&#257;hman castes as
wives. The ranks are said to have been swelled by conversions from
these castes during the time of Sr&#299; M&#257;dhv&#257;ch&#257;rya.
The Shivalli Br&#257;hmans are said to be referred to by the Bants as
Mathumaglu or Mathmalu (bride) in allusion to the fact of their wives
being taken from the Bant caste. Besides the Shivallis, there are other
Tulu Br&#257;hmans, who are said to be recent converts. The Matti
Br&#257;hmans were formerly considered low by the Shivallis, and were
not allowed to sit in the same line with the Shivallis at meal time.
They were only permitted to sit in a cross line, separated from the
Shivallis, though in the same room. This was because the Matti
Br&#257;hmans were supposed to be Mogers (fishing caste) raised to
Br&#257;hmanism by one Vathir&#257;ja Sw&#257;mi, a Sany&#257;si.
Having become Br&#257;hmans, they could not carry on their hereditary
occupation, and, to enable them to earn a livelihood, the Sany&#257;si
gave them some brinjal (<i lang="la-x-bio">Solanum Melongena</i>)
seeds, and advised them to cultivate the plant. From this fact, the
variety of brinjal, which is cultivated at Matti, is called
Vathir&#257;ja gulla. At the present day, the Matti Br&#257;hmans are
on a par with the Shivalli Br&#257;hmans, and have become disciples of
the Sodhe mutt (religious institution) at Udipi. In some of the popular
accounts of Br&#257;hmans, which have been reduced to writing, it is
stated that, during the time of May&#363;ra Varma of the Kadamba
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2711" href="#xd21e2711" name=
"xd21e2711">xlvi</a>]</span>dynasty,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2713src" href="#xd21e2713" name="xd21e2713src">32</a> some
&#256;ndhra Br&#257;hmans were brought into South Canara. As a
sufficient number of Br&#257;hmans were not available for the purpose
of y&#257;gams (sacrifices), these &#256;ndhra Br&#257;hmans selected a
number of families from the non-Br&#257;hman caste, made them
Br&#257;hmans, and chose exogamous sept names for them. Of these names,
Man&#333;li (<i>Cephalandra Indica</i>), P&#275;rala (<i>Psidium
Guyava</i>), Kudire (horse), and &#256;n&#275; (elephant) are
examples.</p>
<p>A character, with which I am very familiar, when measuring the heads
of all sorts and conditions of natives of Southern India, is the
absence of convexity of the segment formed by the posterior portion of
the united parietal bones. The result of this absence of convexity is
that the back of the head, instead of forming a curve gradually
increasing from the top of the head towards the occipital region, as in
the European skull figured in plate III<i>a</i>, forms a flattened area
of considerable length almost at right angles to the base of the skull
as in the &ldquo;Hindu&rdquo; skull represented in <a href=
"#pl0-046">plate III<i>b</i></a>. This character is shown in a marked
degree in <a href="#pl0-048">plate IV</a>, which represents a

characters of various jungle tribes are unhappily becoming lost as the
result of contact metamorphosis from the opening up of the jungles for
planter&rsquo;s estates, and contact with more civilised tribes and
races, both brown and white. In illustration, I may cite the
K&#257;nikars of Travancore, who till recently were in the habit of
sending all their women into the seclusion of the jungle on the arrival
of a stranger near their settlements. This is now seldom done, and some
K&#257;nikars have in modern times settled in the vicinity of towns,
and become domesticated. The primitive short, dark-skinned and
platyrhine type, though surviving, has become changed, and many
leptorhine or mesorhine individuals above middle height are to be met
with. The following are the results of measurements of K&#257;nikars in
the jungle, and at a village some miles from Trivandrum, the capital of
Travancore:&mdash;</p>

<p>Some jungle Chenchus, who inhabit the Nallamalai hills in the
Kurnool district, still exhibit the primitive short stature and high
nasal index, which are characteristic of the unadulterated jungle
tribes. But there is a very conspicuous want of uniformity in their
physical characters, and many individuals are to be met with, above
middle height, or tall, with long narrow noses. A case is recorded, in
which a brick-maker married a Chenchu girl. And I was told of a
B&#333;ya man who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2815" href=

carried out anthropometric observations in Southern India a few years

signal&eacute; depuis longtemps des petits sauvages cr&eacute;pus,
qu&rsquo;on a m&ecirc;me pens&eacute; pouvoir, sur des documents
insuffisants, identifier avec les negritos. En r&eacute;alit&eacute;,
it n&rsquo;existe pas dans ces montagnes, ni probablement nulle part
dans l&rsquo;Inde, un t&eacute;moin de la race primitive comparable,
comme puret&eacute;, aux Andamanais ni m&ecirc;me aux autres Negritos.
Ce que l&rsquo;on trouve l&agrave;, c&rsquo;est simplement, mais
c&rsquo;est fort pr&eacute;cieux, une population m&eacute;tisse qui
continue au del&agrave; du Paria la s&eacute;rie g&eacute;n&eacute;rale
de l&rsquo;Inde. Au bord de la for&ecirc;t vierge ou dans les collines
partiellement d&eacute;frich&eacute;es, il y a des castes demi-Parias,
demi-sauvages. La hi&eacute;rachie sociale les classe au-dessous du
Paria: on peut m&ecirc;me trouver des groupes ou le facies
n&egrave;gre, nettement dessin&eacute;, est tout &agrave; fait
pr&eacute;dominant. Ehbien, dans ces groupes, les chevelures sont en
g&eacute;n&eacute;ral fris&eacute;es, et on en observe quelques-unes
qu&rsquo;on peut m&ecirc;me appeler cr&eacute;pues. On a donc le moyen
de prolonger par l&rsquo;imagination la s&eacute;rie des castes
indiennes jusq&rsquo;au type primitif qui &eacute;tait (nous
n&rsquo;avons plus qu&rsquo;un pas &agrave; faire pour le
reconstruire), un <i>N&egrave;gre</i>.... Nous sommes arrives &agrave;

prolongeant une s&eacute;rie gradu&eacute;e de m&eacute;tis. Par la
m&ecirc;me m&eacute;thode nous pouvons d&eacute;terminer
th&eacute;oriquement la forme du cr&acirc;ne de ce type. Avec une assez
grande certitude, je crois pouvoir affirmer, apr&egrave;s de nombreuses
mesures syst&eacute;matiques, que le n&egrave;gre primitif de
l&rsquo;Inde &eacute;tait sousdolichoc&eacute;phale avec un indice
voisin de 75 ou 76. Sa taille, plus difficile &agrave; pr&eacute;ciser,
car les conditions de vie modifient ce caract&egrave;re, devait
&ecirc;tre petite, plus haute pourtant que celle des Andamanais. Quant
au nom qu&rsquo;il convient de lui attribuer, la discussion des faits
sociaux et linguistiques sur lesquels est fond&eacute;e la notion de
dravidien permet d&rsquo;&eacute;tablir que ce n&egrave;gre
&eacute;tait ant&eacute;rieur aux dravidiens; <span class=

<p>It is worthy of note that Haeckel defines the nose of the Dravidian
as a prominent and narrow organ. For Risley has laid down<a class=

"xd21e3068src">35</a> that, in the Dravidian type, the nose is thick
and broad, and the formula expressing the proportionate dimension
(nasal index) is higher than in any known race, except the Negro; and
that the typical Dravidian, as represented by the M&#257;l&#275;
Pah&#257;ria, has a nose as broad in proportion to its length as the
Negro, while this feature in the Aryan group can fairly bear comparison
with the noses of sixty-eight Parisians, measured by Topinard, which
gave an average of 69.4. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3071" href=

<p>This table demonstrates very clearly an unbroken series ranging from

N&#257;yars and other classes.</p>

</div>
<p>In <a href="#pl0-053">plate V</a> are figured a series of triangles
representing (natural size) the maxima, minima, and average nasal
indices of Br&#257;hmans of Madras city (belonging to the poorer
classes), Tamil Paraiyans, and Paniyans. There is obviously far less
connection between the Br&#257;hman minimum and the Paraiyan maximum
than between the Br&#257;hman and Paraiyan maxima and the Paniyan
average; and the frequent occurrence of high nasal indices, resulting
from short, broad noses, in many classes has to be accounted for. Sir
Alfred Lyall somewhere refers to the gradual Br&#257;hmanising of the
aboriginal non-Arayan, or casteless tribes. &ldquo;They pass,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;into Br&#257;hmanists by a natural upward transition,
which leads them to adopt the religion of the castes immediately above
them in the social scale of the composite population, among which they
settle down; and we may reasonably guess that this process has been
working for centuries.&rdquo; In the Madras Census Report, 1891, Mr. H.
A. Stuart states that &ldquo;it has often been asserted, and is now the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3425" href="#xd21e3425" name=
"xd21e3425">liv</a>]</span>general belief, that the Br&#257;hmans of
the South are not pure Aryans, but are a mixed Aryan and Dravidian
race. In the earliest times, the caste division was much less rigid
than now, and a person of another caste could become a Br&#257;hman by
attaining the Br&#257;hmanical standard of knowledge, and assuming
Br&#257;hmanical functions; and, when we see the Namb&#363;diri
Br&#257;hmans, even at the present day, contracting alliances, informal
though they be, with the women of the country, it is not difficult to
believe that, on their first arrival, such unions were even more
common, and that the children born of them would be recognised as
Br&#257;hmans, though perhaps regarded as an inferior class. However,
those Br&#257;hmans, in whose veins mixed blood is supposed to run, are
even to this day regarded as lower in the social scale, and are not
allowed to mix freely with the pure Br&#257;hman community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Popular traditions allude to wholesale conversions of
non-Br&#257;hmans into Br&#257;hmans. According to such traditions,
R&#257;jas used to feed very large numbers of Br&#257;hmans (a lakh of
Br&#257;hmans) in expiation of some sin, or to gain religious merit. To
make up this large number, non-Br&#257;hmans are said to have been made
Br&#257;hmans at the bidding of the R&#257;jas. Here and there are
found a few sections of Br&#257;hmans, whom the more orthodox
Br&#257;hmans do not recognise as such, though the ordinary members of
the community regard them as an inferior class of Br&#257;hmans. As an
instance may be cited the M&#257;rakas of the Mysore Province. Though
it is difficult to disprove the claim put forward by these people, some
demur to their being regarded as Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p>Between a Br&#257;hman of high culture, with fair complexion, and
long, narrow nose on the one hand, and a less highly civilised
Br&#257;hman with dark skin and short broad nose on the other, there is
a vast difference, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3431" href=
"#xd21e3431" name="xd21e3431">lv</a>]</span>can only be reasonably
explained on the assumption of racial admixture; and it is no insult to
the higher members of the Br&#257;hman community to trace, in their
more lowly brethren, the result of crossing with a dark-skinned, and
broad-nosed race of short stature. Whether the jungle tribe are, as I
believe, the microscopic remnant of a pre-Dravidian people, or, as some
hold, of Dravidians driven by a conquering race to the seclusion of the
jungles, it is to the lasting influence of some such broad-nosed
ancestor that the high nasal index of many of the inhabitants of
Southern India must, it seems to me, be attributed. Viewed in the light
of this remark, the connection between the following mixed collection
of individuals, all of very dark colour, short of stature, and with
nasal index exceeding 90, calls for no explanation:&mdash;</p>

<p>I pass on to a brief consideration of the languages of Southern
India. According to Mr. G. A. Grierson<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3646src" href="#xd21e3646" name="xd21e3646src">36</a> &ldquo;the
Dravidian family comprises all the principal languages of Southern
India. The name Dravidian is a conventional one. It is derived from the
Sanskrit Dravida, a word which is again probably derived from an older
Dramila, Damila, and is identical with the name of Tamil. The name
Dravidian is, accordingly, identical with Tamulian, which name has
formerly been used by European writers as a common designation of the
languages in question. The word Dravida forms part of the denomination
Andhra-Dr&#257;vida-bh&#257;sh&#257;, the language of the Andhras
(<i>i.e.</i>, Telugu), and Dravidas (<i>i.e.</i>, Tamilians), which
Kum&#257;rila Bhatta (probably 7th Century A.D.) employed to denote the
Dravidian family. In India Dravida has been used in more than one
sense. Thus the so-called five Dravidas are Telugu, Kanarese,
Mar&#257;thi, Gujar&#257;ti, and Tamil. In Europe, on the other hand,
Dravidian has long been the common denomination of the whole family of
languages to which Bishop Caldwell applied it in his Comparative
Grammar, and there is no reason for abandoning the name which the
founder of Dravidian philology applied to this group of
speeches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The five principal languages are Tamil, Telugu, Malay&#257;lam,
Canarese, and Oriya. Of these, Oriya belongs to the eastern group of
the Indo-Aryan family, and is spoken in Ganjam, and a portion of the
Vizagapatam district. The population speaking each of these languages,
as recorded at the census, 1901, was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the preparation of the following brief summary of the other
vernacular languages and dialects, I have indented mainly on the
Linguistic Survey of India, and the Madras Census Report, 1901.</p>
<p><i>Savara.</i>&mdash;The language of the Savaras of Ganjam and
Vizagapatam. One of the Mund&#257; languages. Concerning the
Mund&#257;, linguistic family, Mr. Grierson writes as follows.
&ldquo;The denomination Mund&#257; (adopted by Max M&uuml;ller) was not
long allowed to stand unchallenged. Sir George Campbell in 1866
proposed to call the family Kolarian. He was of opinion that Kol had an
older form Kolar, which he thought to be identical with Kanarese
Kallar, thieves. There is absolutely no foundation for this
supposition. Moreover, the name Kolarian is objectionable, as seeming
to suggest a connexion with Aryan which does not exist. The principal
home of the Mund&#257; languages at the present day is the Chota Nagpur
plateau. The Mund&#257; race is much more widely spread than the
Mund&#257; languages. It has already been remarked that it is identical
with the Dravidian race, which forms the bulk of the population of
Southern India.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Gadaba.</i>&mdash;Spoken by the Gadabas of Vizagapatam and
Ganjam. One of the Mund&#257; languages.</p>
<p><i>Kond, Kandh&#299;, or Kui.</i>&mdash;The language of the Kondhs
of Ganjam and Vizagapatam.</p>
<p><i>G&#333;ndi.</i>&mdash;The language of the G&#333;nds, a tribe
which belongs to the Central Provinces, but has overflowed into Ganjam
and Vizagapatam.</p>
<p><i>Gattu.</i>&mdash;A dialect of G&#333;ndi, spoken by some of the
G&#333;nds in Vizagapatam. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3707"
href="#xd21e3707" name="xd21e3707">lviii</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>K&#333;ya or K&#333;i.</i>&mdash;A dialect of G&#333;ndi, spoken
by the K&#333;yis in the Vizagapatam and God&#257;vari districts.</p>
<p><i>Poroja, Parj&#257;, or Parj&#299;.</i>&mdash;A dialect of
G&#333;ndi.</p>
<p><i>Tulu.</i>&mdash;The language largely spoken in South Canara (the
ancient Tuluva). It is described by Bishop Caldwell as one of the most
highly developed languages of the Dravidian family.</p>
<p><i>Koraga.</i>&mdash;Spoken by the Koragas of South Canara. It is
thought by Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3725src" href=
"#xd21e3725" name="xd21e3725src">37</a> to be a dialect of Tulu.</p>
<p><i>Bellera.</i>&mdash;Spoken by the Belleras of South Canara, and
regarded as a dialect of Canarese or Tulu.</p>
<p><i>Toda.</i>&mdash;The language of the Todas of the Nilgiri hills,
concerning which Dr. W. H. R. Rivers writes as follows.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3736src" href="#xd21e3736" name=
"xd21e3736src">38</a> &ldquo;Bernhard Schmid,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3739src" href="#xd21e3739" name="xd21e3739src">39</a> who wrote
in 1837, appears to have known more of the true Toda language than any
one who has written since, and he ascribes two-thirds of the Toda
vocabulary to Tamil, and was unable to trace the remaining third to any
other language. Caldwell<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3742src" href=
"#xd21e3742" name="xd21e3742src">40</a> believed the language of the
Todas to be most closely allied to Tamil. According to Pope,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3745src" href="#xd21e3745" name=
"xd21e3745src">41</a> the language was originally old Canarese with the
addition of a few Tamil forms, but he has included in his vocabulary
words which have probably been borrowed from the Badagas.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Kota.</i>&mdash;A mixture of Canarese and Tamil spoken by the
Kotas of the N&#299;lgiri hills.</p>
<p><i>Badaga.</i>&mdash;The language of the Badagas of the N&#299;lgiri
hills. Said to be an ancient form of Canarese. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3756" href="#xd21e3756" name=
"xd21e3756">lix</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Irula.</i>&mdash;Spoken by the Irulas of the N&#299;lgiris, and
said to be a dialect of Tamil. According to Mr. Stuart, Kasuba or
Kasuva is another dialect of Tamil spoken by the sub-division of the
Irulas which bears the same name.</p>
<p><i>Kurumba.</i>&mdash;Spoken by the Kurumbas of the N&#299;lgiri
hills, Malabar, and Mysore, and regarded as a dialect of Canarese.</p>
<p><i>Konkani.</i>&mdash;A dialect of Mar&#257;thi, spoken almost
entirely in the South Canara district by S&#257;rasvat and Konkani
Br&#257;hmans and Roman Catholic Christians.</p>
<p><i>Mar&#257;thi.</i>&mdash;In the Tanjore district, the descendants
of the former Mar&#257;tha Rajas of Tanjore speak this language. It is
also spoken in the Bellary district, which was formerly under
Mar&#257;tha dominion, by various Mar&#257;tha castes, and in the
feudatory State of Sand&#363;r.</p>
<p><i>Patn&#363;li or Khatri.</i>&mdash;A dialect of Gujar&#257;ti,
spoken by the Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans who have settled for the most part
in the town of Madura. They are immigrants from Saur&#257;shtra in
Gujar&#257;t, who are said to have come south at the invitation of the
N&#257;yak kings of Madura.</p>
<p><i>Lamb&#257;di.</i>&mdash;The language of the nomad Lamb&#257;dis,
Brinj&#257;ris, or Sug&#257;lis. It is described by Mr. W.
Francis<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3781src" href="#xd21e3781" name=
"xd21e3781src">42</a> as a patois &ldquo;usually based on one of the
local vernaculars, and embroidered and diversified with thieves&rsquo;
slang and expressions borrowed from the various localities in which the
tribe has sojourned. Cust thought that Lamb&#257;di was Semi-Dravidian,
but the point is not clear, and it has been classed as
Indo-Aryan.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Korava or Yerukala.</i>&mdash;A dialect of Tamil spoken by the
nomad caste bearing these names. Like the Lamb&#257;dis, they have a
thieves&rsquo; slang. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3789" href=
"#xd21e3789" name="xd21e3789">lx</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Vad&#257;ri.</i>&mdash;Recorded as a vulgar Telugu dialect spoken
by a wandering tribe of quarrymen in the Bombay Presidency, the Berars,
and elsewhere. They are doubtless Odd&#275;s or Wudder navvies, who
have migrated from their home in the Telugu country. <span class=

in South Canara. The title Adhig&#257;ri (one in power) is assumed by
some Agamudaiyans, and Adhik&#257;ri occurs as an exogamous sept of the
Badagas, and the title of village headman among some Oriya castes. In
South Canara, it is a sept of St&#257;nika.</p>
<p><b>&#256;di</b> (primitive or original).&mdash;The name of a

whom the man-lion Narasimha obtained his bride Chenchita.</p>
<p><b>Adichchan.&mdash;</b>A sub-division of N&#257;yar.</p>
<p><b>Adikal</b> (slaves or servants).&mdash;Included among the
Ambalav&#257;sis. It is recorded, in the Travancore Census Report,
1901, that &ldquo;tradition states that Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya, to
test the fidelity of certain Brahmins to the established ordinances of
caste, went to a liquor-shop, and drank some stimulants. Not
recognising that the obligations, from which adepts like Sankara were
free, were none the less binding on the proletariat, the Brahmins that
accompanied the sage made this an excuse for their drinking too.
Sankara is said to have then entered a foundry, and swallowed a cup of
molten metal, and handed another to the Brahmins, who had apparently
made up their minds to do all that may be done by the
&#256;ch&#257;rya. But they begged to differ, apologised to him as
Atiy&#257;ls or humble servants, and accepted social degradation in
expiation of their sinful presumption. They are now the priests in
temples dedicated to Bhadrak&#257;li, and other goddesses who receive
offerings of liquor. They practise sorcery, and aid in the exorcising
of spirits. They have the upanayana-samsk&#257;ra, and wear the sacred
thread. The s&#299;mantam ceremony is not performed. They are to repeat
the G&#257;yatri (hymn) ten times, and observe eleven <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>days&rsquo;
death pollution. Their own caste-men act as priests. The Atiyammamar
wear the same jewellery as the Namb&#363;tiri women, but they do not
screen themselves by a cadjan (palm leaf) umbrella when they go out in
public, nor are they accompanied by a N&#257;yar maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Adimittam.&mdash;</b>An occupational sub-division of
M&#257;r&#257;ns, who clean the court-yards of temples in
Travancore.</p>
<p><b>&#256;disaivar.&mdash;</b>Recorded, in the Madras Census Report,
1901, as &ldquo;a sub-caste of Vell&#257;la. They are singers of
D&#275;v&#257;ra hymns in Saiva temples.&rdquo; The name indicates
those who have been Saivites from the beginning, as opposed to recent
Saivites. &#256;disaivas are Saivites, who have survived the absorbing
influence of the Lingayat sect. Saivites who profess the Ling&#257;yat
doctrines are known as V&#299;rasaivas. Some Pand&#257;rams, who belong
to the S&#333;zhia sub-division of the Vell&#257;las, regularly recite
Tamil verses from Th&#275;v&#257;ram and Tiruv&#257;chagam in Saivite
temples. This being their profession, they are also called &#332;duvar
(readers or reciters).</p>
<p><b>&#256;ditya V&#257;rada.&mdash;</b>Kurubas, who worship their God
on Sunday.</p>
<p><b>Adiy&#257;n.&mdash;</b>Adiy&#257;n (adi, foot) has been
defined<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7655src" href="#xd21e7655" name=
"xd21e7655src">4</a> as meaning literally &ldquo;a slave, but usually
applied to the vassals of Tamburans and other powerful patrons. Each
Adiy&#257;n had to acknowledge his vassalage by paying annually a nuzur
(gift of money) to his patron, and was supposed also to be ready to
render service whenever needed. This yearly nuzur, which did not
generally exceed one or two fanams, was called adima-panam&rdquo;
(slave money), adima meaning feudal dependency on a patron.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p><b>Adiy&#333;di.&mdash;</b>Adiy&#333;di or Atiy&#333;ti, meaning
slave or vassal, has been returned at times of census as a sub-division
of S&#257;mantan. It is, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7663src" href="#xd21e7663" name="xd21e7663src">5</a> &ldquo;the
caste of the Kadattan&#257;d R&#257;jah in North Malabar. The tradition
is that, when he was driven out of his territories in and around
Calicut by the Zamorin, he took shelter under the R&#257;jah of
Chirakkal, who gave him the Kadattan&#257;d country to hold as his
vassal. Some Atiy&#333;tis advance no pretension to be above
N&#257;yars in rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Adutt&#333;n</b> (a bystander).&mdash;A synonym for
K&#257;vutiyan, a caste of Malay&#257;lam barbers. In like manner, the
name Ambattan for Tamil barbers is said to be derived from the Sanskrit
amba (near), s&rsquo;tha (to stand), indicating that they stand near to
shave their clients or treat their patients.</p>
<p><b>Agamudaiyan.&mdash;</b>The Agamudaiyans, Mr. W. Francis
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7674src" href="#xd21e7674" name=
"xd21e7674src">6</a> are &ldquo;a cultivating caste found in all the
Tamil districts. In Chingleput, North Arcot, Salem, Coimbatore and
Trichinopoly, they are much less numerous than they were thirty years
ago. The reason probably is that they have risen in the social scale,
and have returned themselves as Vell&#257;las. Within the same period,
their strength has nearly doubled in Tanjore, perhaps owing to the
assumption of the name by other castes like the Maravans and Kallans.
In their manners and customs they closely follow the Vell&#257;las.
Many of these in the Madura district are the domestic servants of the
Marava Zamindars.&rdquo; The Agamudaiyans who have settled in the North
Arcot district are described<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7677src" href=
"#xd21e7677" name="xd21e7677src">7</a> by Mr. H. A. Stuart as &ldquo;a
class of cultivators differing widely from the Agamudaiyans of the
Madura district. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>The former are closely allied to the Vell&#257;las,
while the latter are usually regarded as a more civilised section of
the southern Maravans. It may be possible that the Agamudaiyans of
North Arcot are the descendants of the first immigrants from the Madura
district, who, after long settlement in the north, severed all
connexions with their southern brethren.&rdquo; In some districts,
Agamudaiyan occurs as a synonym of Vell&#257;las, Pallis and
M&#275;lakk&#257;rans, who consider that Agamudaiyan is a better caste
name than their own.</p>
<p>The Agamudaiyans proper are found in the Tanjore, Madura, and
Tinnevelly districts.</p>
<p>It is noted in the Tanjore Manual that Ahamudaiyar (the equivalent
of Agamudaiyan) is &ldquo;derived from the root &#257;ham, which, in
Tamil, has many significations. In one of these, it means a house, in
another earth, and hence it has two meanings, householder and
landholder; the suffix Udeiy&#257;r indicating ownership. The word is
also used in another form, ahambadiyan, derived from another meaning of
the same root, <i>i.e.</i>, inside. And, in this derivation, it
signifies a particular caste, whose office it was to attend to the
business in the interior of the king&rsquo;s palace, or in the
pagoda.&rdquo; &ldquo;The name,&rdquo; Mr. J. H. Nelson
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7689src" href="#xd21e7689" name=
"xd21e7689src">8</a> &ldquo;is said by the Rev. G. U. Pope, in his
edition of the Abb&eacute; Dubois&rsquo; work,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7692src" href="#xd21e7692" name="xd21e7692src">9</a> to be
derived from aham, a temple, and padi, a step, and to have been given
to them in consequence of their serving about the steps of temples.
But, independently of the fact that Madura pagodas are not approached
by flights of steps, this seems to be a very far-fetched and improbable
derivation of the word. I am inclined to doubt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>whether it
be not merely a vulgar corruption of the well-known word
Ahamudeiy&#257;n, possessor of a house, the title which Tamil Brahmans
often use in speaking of a man to his wife, in order to avoid the
unpolite term husband. Or, perhaps, the name comes from aham in the
sense of earth, and pati, master or possessor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the connection which exists between the Maravans,
Kallans, and Agamudaiyans (<i>see</i> Kallan), the following is one
version of a legend, which is narrated. The father of Ahalya decided to
give her in marriage to one who remained submerged under water for a
thousand years. Indra only managed to remain thus for five hundred
years, but Gautama succeeded in remaining for the whole of the
stipulated period, and became the husband of Ahalya. Indra determined
to have intercourse with her, and, assuming the guise of a cock, went
at midnight to the abode of Gautama, and crowed. Gautama, thinking that
daybreak was arriving, got up, and went to a river to bathe. While he
was away, Indra assumed his form, and accomplished his desire. Ahalya
is said to have recognised the deception after two children, who became
the ancestors of the Maravans and Kallans, were born to her. A third
child was born later on, from whom the Agamudaiyans are descended.
According to another version of the legend, the first-born child is
said to have faced Gautama without fear, and Agamudaiyan is accordingly
derived from aham or agam, pride, and udaiyan, possessor. There is a
Tamil proverb to the effect that a Kallan may come to be a Maravan. By
respectability he may develope into an Agamudaiyan, and, by slow
degrees, become a Vell&#257;la, from which he may rise to be a
Mudaliar.</p>
<p>Of the three castes, Kallan, Maravan and Agamudaiyan, the last are
said to have &ldquo;alone been greatly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>influenced by contact with
Br&#257;hmanism. They engage Br&#257;hman priests, and perform their
birth, marriage, and death ceremonies like the
Vell&#257;las.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7706src" href=
"#xd21e7706" name="xd21e7706src">10</a> I am told that the more
prosperous Agamudaiyans in the south imitate the Vell&#257;las in their
ceremonial observances, and the poorer classes the Maravans.</p>
<p>Agamudaiyan has been returned, at times of census, as a sub-division
of Maravan and Kallan. In some places, the Agamudaiyans style
themselves sons of Sembun&#257;ttu Maravans. At Ramn&#257;d, in the
Madura district, they carry the fire-pot to the burning ground at the
funeral of a Maravan, and also bring the water for washing the corpse.
In the Tanjore district the Agamudaiyans are called Terkittiyar, or
southerners, a name which is also applied to Kallans, Maravans, and
Valaiyans. The ordinary title of the Agamudaiyans is
S&#275;rvaikk&#257;ran, but many of them call themselves, like the
Vell&#257;las, Pillai. Other titles, returned at times of census, are
Adhig&#257;ri and Mudaliar.</p>
<p>At the census, 1891, the following were returned as the more
important sub-divisions of the Agamudaiyans:&mdash;Aivali
N&#257;tt&#257;n, K&#333;ttaipattu, Malain&#257;du, N&#257;ttumangalam,
R&#257;jab&#333;ja, R&#257;jakulam, R&#257;jav&#257;sal, Kallan,
Maravan, Tuluvan (cf. Tuluva Vell&#257;la) and S&#275;rvaikk&#257;ran.
The name R&#257;jav&#257;sal denotes those who are servants of
R&#257;jas, and has been transformed into R&#257;javamsa, meaning those
of kingly parentage. K&#333;ttaipattu means those of the fort, and the
Agamudaiyans believe that the so-called K&#333;ttai Vellalas of the
Tinnevelly district are really K&#333;ttaipattu Agamudaiyans. One
sub-division of the Agamudaiyans is called S&#257;ni (cow-dung). Unlike
the Maravans and Kallans, the Agamudaiyans have no exogamous septs, or
kilais.</p>

<p>It is recorded, in the Mackenzie Manuscripts, that &ldquo;among the
Maravas, the kings or the rulers of districts, or principal men, are
accustomed to perform the ceremony of tying on the t&#257;li, or in
performing the marriage at once in full, with reference to females of
the Agambadiyar tribe. The female children of such marriages can
intermarry with the Maravas, but not among the Agambadiyar tribe. On
the other hand, the male offspring of such marriages is considered to
be of the mother&rsquo;s tribe, and can intermarry with the
Agambadiyas, but not in the tribe of the Maravas.&rdquo; I am told
that, under ordinary circumstances, the offspring of a marriage between
a Maravan and Agamudaiyan becomes an Agamudaiyan, but that, if the
husband is a man of position, the male issues are regarded as Maravans.
Adult marriage appears to be the rule among the Agamudaiyans, but
sometimes, as among the Maravans, Kallans and other castes, young boys
are, in the southern districts, sometimes married to grown-up
girls.</p>
<p>The marriage ceremonial, as carried out among the poorer
Agamudaiyans, is very simple. The sister of the bridegroom proceeds to
the home of the bride on an auspicious day, followed by a few females
carrying a woman&rsquo;s cloth, a few jewels, flowers, etc. The bride
is seated close to a wall, facing east. She is dressed up in the cloth
which has been brought, and seated on a plank. Betel leaves, areca
nuts, and flowers are presented to her by the bridegroom&rsquo;s
sister, and she puts them in her lap. A turmeric-dyed string or garland
is then placed round the bride&rsquo;s neck by the bridegroom&rsquo;s
sister, while the conch shell (musical instrument), is blown. On the
same day the bride is conducted to the home of the bridegroom, and a
feast is held. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=

<p>The more prosperous Agamudaiyans celebrate their marriages according
to the Pur&#257;nic type, which is the form in vogue amongst most of
the Tamil castes, with variations. The astrologer is consulted in order
to ascertain whether the pair agree in some at least of the points
enumerated below. For this purpose, the day of birth, zodiacal signs,
planets and asterisms under which the pair were born, are taken into
consideration:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. <i>V&#257;ram</i> (day of birth).&mdash;Days are calculated,
commencing with the first day after the new moon. Counting from the day
on which the girl was born, if the young man&rsquo;s birthday happens
to be the fourth, seventh, thirteenth, sixteenth, or seventeenth, it is
considered good.</p>
<p>2. <i>Ganam</i> (class or tribe).&mdash;There are three ganams,
called Manusha, D&#275;va, and R&#257;kshasa. Of the twenty-seven
asterisms, Aswini, Bharani, etc., some are Manusha, some D&#275;va, and
some R&#257;kshasa ganam. Ashtham and Sw&#257;thi are considered to be
of D&#275;va ganam, so individuals born under these asterisms are
regarded as belonging to D&#275;va ganam. Those born under the
asterisms Bharani, R&#333;gini, P&#363;ram, P&#363;r&#257;dam,
Uththar&#257;dam, etc., belong to the Manusha ganam. Under
R&#257;kshasa ganam are included Krithika, &#256;yilyam, Makam,
Vis&#257;kam, and other asterisms. The bridal pair should belong to the
same ganam, as far as possible. Manusha and D&#275;va is a tolerable
combination, whereas R&#257;kshasa and D&#275;va, or R&#257;kshasa and
Manusha, are bad combinations.</p>
<p>3. <i>Sthrid&#299;rgam</i> (woman&rsquo;s longevity).&mdash;The
young man&rsquo;s birthday should be beyond the thirteenth day,
counting from the birthday of the girl.</p>
<p>4. <i>Y&#333;ni</i> (female generative organs).&mdash;The asterisms
are supposed to belong to several animals. An <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>individual belongs to the animal to which the
asterism under which he was born belongs. For example, a man is a horse
if his asterism is Aswini, a cow if his asterism is
Uththiratt&#257;dhi, and so on. The animals of husband and wife must be
on friendly terms, and not enemies. The elephant and man, horse and
cow, dog and monkey, cat and mouse, are enemies. The animals of man and
wife should not both be males. Nor should the man be a female, or the
wife a male animal.</p>
<p>5. <i>R&#257;si</i> (zodiacal sign).&mdash;Beginning from the
girl&rsquo;s zodiacal sign, the young man&rsquo;s should be beyond the
sixth.</p>
<p>6. <i>R&#257;syathipathi</i> (planet in the zodiacal
sign).&mdash;The ruling planets of the zodiacal signs of the pair
should not be enemies.</p>
<p>7. <i>Vasyam.</i>&mdash;The zodiacal signs of the pair should be
compatible, <i>e.g.</i>, Midunam and Kanni, Singam and Makaram, Dhanus
and M&#299;nam, Thul&#257;m and Makaram, etc.</p>
<p>8. <i>Rajju</i> (string).&mdash;The twenty-seven asterisms are
arranged at various points on four parallel lines drawn across three
triangles. These lines are called the leg, thigh, abdomen, and neck
rajjus. The vertices of the triangles are the head rajjus. The
asterisms of the pair should not be on the same rajju, and it is
considered to be specially bad if they are both on the neck.</p>
<p>9. <i>Vriksham</i> (tree).&mdash;The asterisms belong to a number of
trees, <i>e.g.</i>:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Aswini, <i lang="la-x-bio">Strychnos Nux-vomica</i>.</li>
<li>Bharani, <i lang="la-x-bio">Phyllanthus Emblica</i>.</li>
<li>Krithikai, <i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus glomerata</i>.</li>
<li>P&#363;ram, <i lang="la-x-bio">Butea frondosa</i>.</li>
<li>Hastham, <i lang="la-x-bio">Sesbania grandiflora</i>.</li>
<li>Thiruv&#333;nam, <i lang="la-x-bio">Calotropis gigantea</i>.</li>
<li>Uththiratt&#257;dhi, <i lang="la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some of the trees are classed as milky, and others as dry. The young
man&rsquo;s tree should be dry, and that of the girl milky, or both
milky.</p>
<p>10. <i>Pakshi</i> (birds).&mdash;Certain asterisms also belong to
birds, and the birds of the pair should be on friendly terms,
<i>e.g.</i>, peacock and fowl.</p>
<p>11. <i>J&#257;di</i> (caste).&mdash;The zodiacal signs are grouped
into castes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Br&#257;hman, Kark&#257;takam, M&#299;nam, and Dhanus.</li>
<li>Kshatriya, M&#275;sham, Vrischikam.</li>
<li>Vaisya, Kumbam, Thul&#257;m.</li>
<li>S&#363;dra, Rishabam, Makaram.</li>
<li>Lower castes, Midhunam, Singam, and Kanni.</li>
</ul>
<p>The young man should be of a higher caste, according to the zodiacal
signs, than the girl.</p>
<p>After ascertaining the agreement of the pair, some close relations
of the young man proceed to some distance northward, and wait for
omens. If the omens are auspicious, they are satisfied. Some, instead
of so going, go to a temple, and seek the omens either by placing
flowers on the idol, and watching the direction in which they fall, or
by picking up a flower from a large number strewn in front of the idol.
If the flower picked up, and the one thought of, are of the same
colour, it is regarded as a good omen. The betrothal ceremony is an
important event. As soon as the people have assembled, the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party place in their midst the pariyam cloth and
jewels. Some responsible person inspects them, and, on his pronouncing
that they are correct, permission is given to draw up the lagna patrika
(letter of invitation, containing the date of marriage, etc.).
Vign&#275;swara (the elephant god Gan&#275;sa) is then worshipped, with
the lagna patrika in front of him. This is followed by the announcement
of the forthcoming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13"
name="pb13">13</a>]</span>marriage by the pur&#333;hit (priest), and
the settlement of the amount of the pariyam (bride&rsquo;s money). For
the marriage celebration, a pandal (booth) is erected, and a dais,
constructed of clay and laterite earth, is set up inside it. From the
day on which the pandal is erected until the wedding day, the
contracting couple have to go through the nalagu ceremony separately or
together. This consists in having their bodies smeared with turmeric
paste (<i lang="la-x-bio">Phaseolus Mungo</i> paste), and gingelly
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Sesamum</i>) oil. On the wedding day, the
bridegroom, after a clean shave, proceeds to the house of the bride.
The finger and toe-nails of the bride are cut. The pair offer pongal
(boiled rice) to the family deity and their ancestors. A square space
is cleared in the centre of the dais for the sacred fire (h&#333;mam).
A many-branched lamp, representing the thousand-eyed Indra, is placed
to the east of the square. The pur&#333;hit, who is regarded as
equivalent to Yama (the god of death), and a pot with a lamp on it
representing Agni d&#275;vata, occupy the south-east corner. Women
representing Niruti (a d&#275;vata) are posted in the south-west
corner.</p>
<p>The direction of Varuna (the god of water) being west, the
bridegroom occupies this position. The best man, who represents
V&#257;yu (the god of wind) is placed in the north-west corner. As the
position of Kub&#275;ra (the god of wealth) is the north, a person,
with a bag full of money, is seated on that side. A grinding-stone and
roller, representing Siva and Sakthi, are placed in the north-east
corner, and, at their side, pans containing nine kinds of seedlings,
are set. Seven pots are arranged in a row between the grinding-stone
and the branched lamp. Some married women bring water from seven
streams or seven different places, and pour it into a pot in front of
the lamp. The milk-post (p&#257;l kambam) is set <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>up
between the lamp and the row of pots. This post is usually made of
twigs of <i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus religiosa</i>, <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Ficus bengalensis</i>, and <i lang="la-x-bio">Erythrina
indica</i>, tied together and representing Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva.
Sometimes, however, twigs of <i lang="la-x-bio">Odina Wodier</i>, and
green bamboo sticks, are substituted. At the close of the marriage
ceremonies, the <i lang="la-x-bio">Erythrina</i> or <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Odina</i> twig is planted, and it is regarded as a good sign
if it takes root and grows. The sacred fire is kindled, and the
bridegroom goes through the upanayana (thread investiture) and other
ceremonies. He then goes away from the house in procession
(parad&#275;sa prav&#275;sam), and is met by the bride&rsquo;s father,
who brings him back to the pandal. The bride&rsquo;s father and mother
then wash his feet, and rings are put on his toes (k&#257;lkattu, or
tying the leg). The pur&#333;hit gives the bridegroom a thread
(kankanam), and, after washing the feet of the bride&rsquo;s father and
mother, ties it on his wrist. A thread is also tied on the left wrist
of the bride. The pair being seated in front of the sacred fire, a
ceremony called N&#257;ndisr&#257;dham (memorial service to ancestors)
is performed, and new clothes are given to the pair. The next item is
the tying of the t&#257;li (marriage badge). The t&#257;li is usually
tied on a turmeric-dyed thread, placed on a cocoanut, and taken round
to be blessed by all present. Then the pur&#333;hit gives the t&#257;li
to the bridegroom, and he ties it on the bride&rsquo;s neck amidst
silence, except for the music played by the barber or
M&#275;lakk&#257;ran musicians. While the t&#257;li is being tied, the
bridegroom&rsquo;s sister stands behind the bride, holding a lamp in
her hand. The bridegroom ties one knot, and his sister ties two knots.
After the t&#257;li-tying, small plates of gold or silver, called
pattam, are tied on the foreheads of the pair, and presents of money
and cloths are made to them by their relations and friends. They then
go seven times round the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href=
"#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>pandal, and, at the end of the
seventh round, they stand close to the grinding-stone, on which the
bridegroom places the bride&rsquo;s left foot. They take their seats on
the dais, and the bridegroom, taking some parched rice (pori) from the
bride&rsquo;s brother, puts it in the sacred fire. Garlands of flowers
are given to the bride and bridegroom, who put them on, and exchange
them three or five times. They then roll flowers made into a ball. This
is followed by the waving of &#257;rathi (coloured water), and
circumambulation of the pandal by the pair, along with the
ashtamangalam or eight auspicious things, viz., the bridesmaid, best
man, lamp, vessel filled with water, mirror, ankusam (elephant goad),
white chamara (yak&rsquo;s tail fly-flapper), flag and drum. Generally
the pair go three times round the pandal, and, during the first turn, a
cocoanut is broken near the grinding-stone, and the bride is told that
it is Siva, and the roller Sakthi, the two combined being emblematical
of Ardan&#257;risvara, a bisexual representation of Siva and Parvathi.
During the second round, the story of Arundati is repeated to the
bride. Arundati was the wife of the Rishi Vasishta, and is looked up to
as a model of conjugal fidelity. The morning star is supposed to be
Arundati, and the pur&#333;hit generally points it out to the bridal
pair at the close of the ceremonial, which terminates with three
h&#333;mams. The wedding may be concluded in a single day, or last for
two or three days.</p>
<p>The dead are either buried or cremated. The corpse is carried to the
burning or burial-ground on a bier or palanquin. As the Agamudaiyans
are Saivites, Pand&#257;rams assist at the funeral ceremonies. On the
second or third day after death, the son and others go to the spot
where the corpse was buried or burnt, and offer food, etc., to the
deceased. A pot of water is left at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>spot. Those who are
particular about performing the death ceremonies on an elaborate scale
offer cooked food to the soul of dead person until the fifteenth day,
and carry out the final death ceremonies (karm&#257;ndhiram) on the
sixteenth day. Presents are then given to Br&#257;hmans, and, after the
death pollution has been removed by sprinkling with holy water
(puny&#257;ham), a feast is given to the relatives.</p>
<p>The Agamudaiyans worship various minor deities, such as Aiyanar,
Pid&#257;ri, and Karupannasw&#257;mi.</p>
<p><b>Agaru.&mdash;</b>Agaru, or Avaru, is recorded, in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, as a small caste of Telugu cultivators in
Vizagapatam and Ganjam, who are also sellers of vegetables and betel
leaves. Agaru is said to mean betel in their language, which they call
Bh&#257;sha, and contains a good deal of Oriya. An extensive colony of
Agarus is settled at Nellimerla near Vizianagram. Both males and
females engage in the cultivation of the betel vine, and different
kinds of greens, which find a ready sale in the Vizianagram market.
Marriage is usually after puberty, and an Oriya Br&#257;hman
officiates. The dead are burnt.</p>
<p><b>Agarw&#257;l.&mdash;</b>A few members of this Upper India trading
caste, who deal in grain and jewellery, and are also bankers and
usurers, have been returned at times of census.</p>
<p><b>Agasa.&mdash;</b>In the South Canara district, there are three
distinct classes of washermen, viz., (1) Konkani Christians; (2)
Canarese-speaking washermen, who seem to be allied to the Agasas of
Mysore; (3) Tulu-speaking washermen. The Tulu-speaking Agasas follow
the aliya sant&#257;na law of inheritance (in the female line).
Madiv&#257;la (madi, a clean cloth) is a synonym for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>Agasa.
The word Agasa is derived from agasi, a turban.</p>
<p>The Agasas of Mysore have been described as follows.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7906src" href="#xd21e7906" name=
"xd21e7906src">11</a> &ldquo;The Agasa is a member of the village
hierarchy, his office being hereditary, and his remuneration being
grain fees from the ryots. Besides washing, he occasionally ekes out
his substance by carrying on his donkeys grain from place to place. He
is also employed in bearing the torch in marriage and other public
ceremonies. The principal object of worship is the pot of boiling water
(ubbe), in which dirty clothes are steeped. Animals are sacrificed to
the god with the view of preventing the clothes being burnt in the ubbe
pot. Under the name of Bh&#363;ma D&#275;va, there are temples
dedicated to this god in some large towns, the service being conducted
by p&#363;j&#257;ris (priests) of the Agasa caste. The Agasas are
Vishnuvaits, and pray to Vishnu, Pattalamma, and the Saktis. Their
gurus (religious preceptors) are S&#257;t&#257;nis. A unique custom is
attached to the washerman&rsquo;s office. When a girl-wife attains
puberty, it is the duty and privilege of the washerman to carry the
news, accompanied by certain presents, to her husband&rsquo;s parents,
for which the messenger is duly rewarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tulu Madiv&#257;las of the South Canara district, like other
Tulu castes, have exogamous septs or balis. They will wash clothes for
all castes above the Billavas. They also supply cloths for decorating
the marriage booth and funeral cars, and carry torches. They worship
bh&#363;thas (devils), of whom the principal one seems to be Jumadi. At
the time of k&#333;las (bh&#363;tha festivals), the Madiv&#257;las have
the right to cut off the heads of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>fowls or goats, which are
sacrificed. The animals are held by Pombadas or Paravas, and the
Madiv&#257;la decapitates them. On the seventh day after the birth of a
child, the washerwoman ties a thread round its waist. For purificatory
ceremonies, the Madiv&#257;li should give washed clothes to those under
pollution.</p>
<p>In their ceremonial observances, the Madiv&#257;las closely follow
the Bants. In some places, they have a headman called, as among the
Bants, Gurikara or Guttinaya. At marriages, the pouring of the
dh&#257;re water over the united hands of the bride and bridegroom is
the duty of the father or maternal uncle of the bride, not of the
headman.</p>
<p>Some Mar&#257;tha washermen call themselves Dandu (army) Agasa.</p>
<p>The insigne of the washermen at Conjeeveram is a pot, such as that
in which clothes are boiled.</p>
<p><b>Agastya</b> (the name of a sage).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
Kondaiyamkottai Maravans.</p>
<p><b>Agni</b> (fire).&mdash;An exogamous sept of the Kurubas and
Gollas, and sub-division of the Pallis or Vanniyans. The equivalent
Aggi occurs as an exogamous sept of B&#333;ya. The Pallis claim to be
Agnikula Kshatriyas, <i>i.e.</i>, to belong to the fire race of
Kshatriyas.</p>
<p><b>Agrah&#257;rekala.&mdash;</b>A sub-division of Bhatr&#257;zu,
meaning those who belong to the agrah&#257;ram, or Br&#257;hman quarter
of a village.</p>
<p><b>Ahir.&mdash;</b>A few members of this Upper India caste of
cowherds have been returned at times of census.</p>
<p><b>Ahmedi.&mdash;</b>Returned, at times of census, as a general name
for Muhammadans.</p>
<p><b>Aivattukuladavaru</b> (people of fifty families).&mdash;A synonym
for B&#257;kuda. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=

<p><b>Aiya.&mdash;</b>Aiya or Ayya, meaning father, is the title of
many classes, which include D&#257;sari, D&#275;v&#257;nga, Golla,
&#298;diga, Jangam, Konda Dora, K&#333;mati, Koppala Velama, Linga
Balija, Mangala, M&#363;ka Dora, Paidi, S&#257;t&#257;ni,
Serv&#275;g&#257;ra, and Tambala. It is further a title of the
Patn&#363;lkarans, who claim to be Br&#257;hmans, and a sub-division of
the Tamil Pallans.</p>
<p>Aiyar occurs very widely as a title among Tamil Br&#257;hmans, and
is replaced in the Telugu and Canarese countries by Bhatlu, Pantulu,
and S&#257;strulu. It is noted by the Rev. A. Marg&ouml;schis that
&ldquo;the honorific title Aiyar was formerly used exclusively by
Br&#257;hmans, but has now come to be used by every native clergyman.
The name which precedes the title will enable us to discover whether
the man is Christian or Hindu. Thus Yesudian Aiyar means the Aiyar who
is the servant of Jesus.&rdquo; The Rev. G. U. Pope, the well-known
Tamil scholar, was known as Pope Aiyar.</p>
<p><b>Aiyanar.&mdash;</b>A sub-division of Kallan, named after Aiyanar,
the only male deity among the Gr&#257;ma D&#275;vata or village
deities.</p>
<p><b>Aiyarakulu.&mdash;</b>In the Madras Census Report, 1901,
Aiyarakam is summed up as being a caste of Telugu cultivators, who, in
their social and religious observances, closely follow the K&#257;pus
and Balijas, may intermarry with Telagas, and will accept drinking
water from the hands of Gollas. According to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao, to
whom I am indebted for the following note, the Aiyarakulu are a section
of K&#257;pus, who rose in the social scale by Royal favour. The name
is derived from aiya and rikam, denoting the act of being an aiya or
distinguished person. The Aiyarakulu state that their forefathers were
soldiers in the Vizianagram army, and rendered great services to the
R&#257;jas. They have a story <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href=
"#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>to the effect that, on one occasion,
they proceeded on an expedition against a Golconda force, and gave so
much trouble to the Muhammadan commander thereof that, after putting
them to the sword, he proceeded to their own country, to destroy their
homes. On hearing of this, the women, dressing themselves in male
attire, advanced with bayonets and battle-axes against the Muhammadans,
and drove them off in great disorder. The R&#257;ja, in return for
their gallant conduct, adorned their legs with silver bangles, such as
the women still wear at the present day.</p>
<p>The Aiyarakulu are divided into g&#333;tras, such as n&#257;ga
(cobra), t&#257;b&#275;lu (tortoise), etc., which are strictly
totemistic, and are further divided into exogamous septs or
intip&#275;rulu. The custom of m&#275;narikam, according to which a man
should marry his maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter, is in force. Girls
are married before puberty, and a Br&#257;hman officiates at the
wedding rites, during which the bride and bridegroom wear silver sacred
threads, which are subsequently converted into rings. Some Aiyarakulu
call themselves R&#257;zus, and wear the sacred thread, but interdine
and intermarry with other members of the community. The remarriage of
widows, and divorce are forbidden.</p>
<p>The principal occupation of the Aiyarakulus is cultivating, but, in
some parts, many of them are cart-drivers plying between the plains of
Vizagapatam and the Agency tracts. The usual title of members of the
caste is P&#257;trudu.</p>
<p><b>&#256;k&#257;sam</b> (sky).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
D&#275;v&#257;nga.</p>
<p><b>Akattu Charna.&mdash;</b>A sub-division of N&#257;yar.</p>
<p><b>Akattulavar.&mdash;</b>A name, indicating those inside (in

<p><b>&#256;kula</b> (betel leaf: <i lang="la-x-bio">Piper
Betle</i>).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kamma and Bonthuk Savara, and a
sub-division of K&#257;pu. The presentation of betel leaves and areca
nuts, called p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri, as a complimentary offering is a
wide-spread Indian custom.</p>
<p><b>&#256;la.&mdash;</b>A sub-division of Golla.</p>
<p><b>Alagi</b> (pot).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Vakkaliga.</p>
<p><b>Alavan.&mdash;</b>The Alavans are summed up, in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, as &ldquo;workers in salt-pans, who are found only in
Madura and Tinnevelly. Their titles are Pannaiyan and M&#363;ppan. They
are not allowed to enter Hindu temples.&rdquo; In the Travancore Census
Report, 1901, it is recorded that &ldquo;the Alavans or Uppalavans
(salt Alavans) are so called because they work in alams or salt-pans.
Three or four centuries ago, seven families of them are said to have
been brought over from the P&#257;ndyan territory to Travancore, to
work in the salt-pans. It is said that there are at T&#257;marakkulam,
Puttalam, and other places in South Travancore, inscriptions recording
their immigration, but these have not been deciphered. They speak
Tamil. They are flesh-eaters. Drinking is rare among them. Burial was
the rule in ancient days, but now the dead are sometimes burned.
Tattooing is a general custom. The tutelary deities are S&#257;sta and
Bhadrak&#257;li. As a class the Alavans are very industrious. There are
no better salt labourers in all Southern India.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Albino.&mdash;</b>The picture drawn by the Abb&eacute;
Dubois<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8009src" href="#xd21e8009" name=

&ldquo;This extreme <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22"
name="pb22">22</a>]</span>fairness,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is
unnatural, and makes them very repulsive to look at. In fact, these
unfortunate beings are objects of horror to every one, and even their
parents desert them. They are looked upon as lepers. They are called
Kakrelaks as a term of reproach. Kakrelaks are horrible insects,
disgustingly dirty, which give forth a loathsome odour, and shun the
day and its light. The question has been raised as to whether these
degenerate individuals can produce children like themselves, and
afflicted with nyctalopia. Such a child has never come under my
observation; but I once baptised the child of a female Kakrelak, who
owed its birth to a rash European soldier. These unfortunate wretches
are denied decent burial after death, and are cast into
ditches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reference to albinos by the observant Abb&eacute; may be
amplified by the notes taken on several albino Natives in Madras and
Mysore, which show, <i>inter alia</i>, that the lot of the present day
albino is not an unhappy one.</p>

<p><b>Alia.&mdash;</b>The Alias are an Oriya cultivating caste, found
mainly in the Gums&#363;r t&#257;luk of Ganjam. In the Madras Census
Report, 1891, it is suggested that the name is derived from the
Sanskrit holo, meaning a plough. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>further suggestions have
been made that it is derived from alo, meaning crop, or from Ali, a
killa or t&#257;luk of Orissa, whence the Aliyas have migrated. In
social position the Alias rank below the Bhond&#257;ris and Odiyas, who
will not accept water touched by them.</p>
<p>Various titles occur within the caste, <i>e.g.</i>, Biswalo, Bonjo,
B&#257;riko, Jenna, Kampo, Kondwalo, Lenka, Mahanti, Molla N&#257;hako,
P&#257;tro, Podh&#257;no, Podiy&#257;li, Ravuto, Siyo, and Sw&#257;yi.
Like other Oriya castes, the Alias have g&#333;tras, and the marriage
rules based on titles and g&#333;tras are peculiar. A Podh&#257;no man
may, for example, marry a Podh&#257;no girl, if their g&#333;tras are
different. Further, two people, whose g&#333;tras are the same, may
marry if they have a different title. Thus, a man, whose g&#333;tra is
Goru and title Podh&#257;no, may marry a girl of a family of which the
g&#333;tra is Goru, but title other than Podh&#257;no.</p>
<p>Infant marriage is the rule, and, if a girl does not secure a
husband before she reaches maturity, she goes through a mock marriage
ceremony, in which the bridegroom is represented by a brass vessel or
an arrow. Like many other Oriya castes, the Aliyas follow the Chaitanya
form of Vaishnavism, and also worship various T&#257;kur&#257;nis
(village deities).</p>
<p><b>Alige</b> (drum).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kuruba.</p>
<p><b>Aliya Sant&#257;nam.&mdash;</b>Inheritance in the female line.
The equivalent, in the Canara country, of the Malay&#257;li
marumakkath&#257;yam.</p>
<p><b>Allam</b> (ginger).&mdash;An exogamous sept of M&#257;la.</p>
<p><b>Allikulam</b> (lily clan).&mdash;Returned, at times of census, as
a sub-division of Anappan.</p>
<p><b>&#256;lvar.&mdash;</b>An exogamous sept of Toreya. &#256;lvar is
a synonym of Garuda, the winged vehicle of Vishnu. &#256;lvar
D&#257;sari occurs as a sub-division of Valluvans, which claims descent
from Tirupp&#257;n &#256;lvar, one of the Vaishnava saints.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=

<p><b>Amar&#257;vatiyavaru.&mdash;</b>A name, denoting people of

"xd21e8071src" href="#xd21e8071" name="xd21e8071src">13</a> as a
sub-division of Desabhaga M&#257;digas. Amar&#257;vati also occurs as a
sub-division, or n&#257;du, of Vallamban.</p>
<p><b>Ambalakk&#257;ran.&mdash;</b>In the Madras Census Report, 1891,
Mr. H. A. Stuart writes that &ldquo;Ambalakk&#257;ran (ambalam, an open
place<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8078src" href="#xd21e8078" name=
"xd21e8078src">14</a>) is the usual designation of a head of a village
in the Maravan and Kallan districts, and it is, or was the common
agnomen of Kallans. I am not able to state what is the precise
connection between the Ambalakk&#257;ran and Kallan castes, but, from
some accounts which I have obtained, the Ambalakk&#257;rans seem to be
very closely connected, if not identical with Muttiriyans (Telugu
Mutr&#257;cha), who have been classed as village watchmen; and this is
borne out by the sub-divisions returned, for, though no less than
109,263 individuals have given Ambalakk&#257;ran as the sub-division
also, yet, of the sub-divisions returned, Muttiriyan and Mutr&#257;cha
are the strongest. Marriage is usually deferred until after puberty,
and widow re-marriage is permitted, but there does not seem to be the
same freedom of divorce at will as is found among Kallans, Maravans,
etc. The dead are either burnt or buried. The consumption of flesh and
liquor is allowed. Their usual agnomen is said to be
S&#275;rvaikk&#257;ran, but the titles Muttiriyan, Ambalakk&#257;ran,
Malavar&#257;y&#257;n, Mutar&#257;san, and Vannian are also used. The
usual agnomen of Muttiriyans, on the other hand, is said to be
N&#257;yakkan (Naik).&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1901, the Ambalakk&#257;rans are summed
up as follows. &ldquo;A Tamil caste of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>cultivators and village
watchmen. Till recently the term Ambalakk&#257;ran was considered to be
a title of the Kallans, but further enquiries have shown that it is the
name of a distinct caste, found chiefly in the Trichinopoly district.
The Ambalakk&#257;rans and Muttiriyans of a village in Musiri
t&#257;luk wrote a joint petition, protesting against their being
classified as Kallans, but nevertheless it is said that the Kallans of
Madura will not eat in Ambalakk&#257;ran&rsquo;s houses. There is some
connection between Ambalakk&#257;rans, Muttiriyans, Mutr&#257;chas,
Ur&#257;lis, V&#275;dans, Valaiyans, and V&#275;ttuvans. It seems
likely that all of them are descended from one common parent stock.
Ambalakk&#257;rans claim to be descended from Kannappa N&#257;yanar,
one of the sixty-three Saivite saints, who was a V&#275;dan or hunter
by caste. In Tanjore the Valaiyans declare themselves to have a similar
origin, and in that district Ambalakk&#257;ran and Muttiriyan seem to
be synonymous with Valaiyan. [Some Valaiyans have Ambalakk&#257;ran as
a title.] Moreover, the statistics of the distribution of the Valaiyans
show that they are numerous in the districts where Ambalakk&#257;rans
are few, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, which looks as though certain
sections of them had taken to calling themselves Ambalakk&#257;rans.
The upper section of the Ambalakk&#257;rans style themselves Pillai,
which is a title properly belonging to Vell&#257;las, but the others
are usually called M&#363;ppan in Tanjore, and Ambalakk&#257;ran,
Muttiriyan, and S&#275;rvaig&#257;ran in Trichinopoly. The headman of
the caste panch&#257;yat (council) is called the
K&#257;riyakk&#257;ran, and his office is hereditary in particular
families. Each headman has a peon called the Kudi-pillai, whose duty it
is to summon the panch&#257;yat when necessary, and to carry messages.
For this he gets an annual fee of four annas from each family of the
caste in his village. The caste has certain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>endogamous sections. Four of them are said to be
Muttiriyan or Mutr&#257;cha, K&#257;valgar, Vanniyan, and Valaiyan. A
member of any one of these is usually prohibited by the panch&#257;yats
from marrying outside it on pain of excommunication. Their customs are
a mixture of those peculiar to the higher castes and those followed by
the lower ones. Some of them employ Br&#257;hmans as pur&#333;hits
(priests), and wear the sacred thread at funerals and sr&#257;ddhas
(memorial services for the dead). Yet they eat mutton, pork, and fowls,
drink alcohol, and allow the marriage of widows and divorced
women.&rdquo; Muttiriyan and K&#257;valgar both mean watchman. Vanniyan
is certainly a separate caste, some members of which take
Ambalakk&#257;ran as a title. The Ambalakk&#257;rans are apparently
Valaiyans, who have separated themselves from the main stock on account
of their prosperity.</p>
<p>For the following note, I am indebted to Mr. F. R. Hemingway. The
Ambalakk&#257;rans or Muttiriyans are more numerous in the Trichinopoly
district and Pudukk&#333;ttai than in any other part of the Presidency.
Though they have been treated as separate castes, they appear to be one
and the same in this district, generally calling themselves Muttiriyan
in the Trichinopoly t&#257;luk, and Ambalakk&#257;ran elsewhere, and
having no objection to either name. They admit they are called
Valaiyans, but repudiate any connection with the caste of that name,
and explain the appellation by a story that, when Siva&rsquo;s ring was
swallowed by a fish in the Ganges, one of their ancestors invented the
first net (valai) made in the world. As relics of their former
greatness they point to the thousand-pillared mantapam at Srirangam,
which is called muttarasan koradu, and a big matam at Palni, both of
which, they say, were built by their kings. To the latter every
household of the caste subscribes four annas <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>annually. They say that they were born of the
sweat (muttu, a pearl or bead of perspiration) of Parama-siva. The
caste is divided into a number of n&#257;dus, the names and number of
which are variously given. Some of these are Ettarai, K&#333;ppu,
Adavatt&#363;r, T&#299;r&#257;mp&#257;laiyam,
V&#299;m&#257;nayakkanp&#257;laiyam in the Trichinopoly t&#257;luk, and
Am&#363;r, Savindippatti, and Karung&#257;li in Musiri t&#257;luk.
Widow remarriage is allowed in some of these n&#257;dus, and not in
others. They use the titles Muttiriyan, Ambalakk&#257;ran,
S&#275;rvaik&#257;ran, and K&#257;valk&#257;ran. They admit their
social inferiority to the Vell&#257;lans, Kallans, Nattam&#257;ns, and
Reddis, from all of whom they will accept meals, but consider
themselves superior to Pallis, Ur&#257;lis, Uppiliyans, and Valaiyans.
Their usual occupation is cultivation, but they have also taken to
petty trade, and some earn a living as masons and k&#257;valgars
(watchmen). They wear the sacred thread during their marriages and
funerals. They have panch&#257;yats for each village and for the
n&#257;du, and have also a number of the Patnattu Chettis, who are
recognized as elders of the caste, and sit with the head of the
n&#257;du to decide cases of adultery, etc.</p>
<p><b>Ambalav&#257;si.&mdash;</b>This is summed up, in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;a generic name applied to all classes of
temple servants in Malabar. There are many sub-divisions of the caste,
such as Poduv&#257;l, Ch&#257;kkiyar, Nambiyassan, Pid&#257;ran,
Pish&#257;rodi, V&#257;riyan, Nambi, Teyyamb&#257;di, etc., which are
assigned different services in the Hindu temples, such as the
preparation of garlands, the sweeping of the floor, the fetching of
fire-wood, the carrying of the idols in procession, singing, dancing,
and so on. Like most of the temple servant classes, they are inferior
to the lower Br&#257;hmans, such as the M&#363;ssads, and food will not
be taken from the hands of most of them even by N&#257;yars.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Travancore Census Report, 1901, it is noted that &ldquo;the
term Ambalav&#257;si (one who lives in a temple) is a group-name, and
is applied to castes, whose occupation is temple service. The
K&#275;ralam&#257;h&#257;tmya speaks of them as
Ksh&#275;trav&#257;sinah, which means those who live in temples. They
are also known as Antar&#257;las, from their occupying an intermediate
position between the Br&#257;hmans and the Br&#257;hmanical Kshatriyas
of Malabar on the one hand, and the S&#363;dras on the other. While
according to one view they are fallen Br&#257;hmans, others, such as
the writer of the K&#275;ralolpatti, would put them down as an advance
from the S&#363;dras. The castes recognised as included in the generic
name of Ambalav&#257;si are:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All these castes are not connected with pagodas, nor do the
Mutt&#257;tus, who are mainly engaged in temple service, come under
this group, strictly speaking. The <i>rationale</i> of their occupation
seems to be that, in accepting duty in temples and consecrating their
lives to the service of God, they hope to be absolved from the sins
inherited from their fathers. In the case of ascent from lower castes,
the object presumably is the acquisition of additional religious
merit.... The delinquent Br&#257;hman cannot be retained in the
Br&#257;hmanic function without lowering the standard of his caste. He
had, therefore, to be allotted other functions. Temple service of
various kinds, such as garland-making for the Pushpakan, V&#257;riyar
and others, and popular recitation of God&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>works
for the Ch&#257;kkiyar, were found to hold an intermediate place
between the internal functions of the Br&#257;hmans and the external
functions of the other castes, in the same sense in which the temples
themselves are the exoteric counterparts of an esoteric faith, and
represent a position between the inner and the outer economy of nature.
Hence arose probably an intermediate status with intermediate functions
for the Antar&#257;las, the intermediates of Hindu Society. The
Kshatriyas, having commensal privileges with the Br&#257;hmans, come
next to them in the order of social precedence. In the matter of
pollution periods, which seem to be in inverse ratio to the position of
the caste, the Br&#257;hmans observe 10 days, the Kshatriyas 11 days,
and the S&#363;dras of Malabar (N&#257;yars) 16 days. The
Ambalav&#257;sis generally observe pollution for 12 days. In some
cases, however, it is as short as 10, and in others as long as 13 and
even 14, but never 16 days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is further recorded, in the Cochin Census Report, 1901, that
&ldquo;Ambalav&#257;sis (literally temple residents) are persons who
have the privilege of doing service in temples. Most of the castes have
grown out of sexual relations between members of the higher and lower
classes, and are therefore Anulomajas and Pratilomajas.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8143src" href="#xd21e8143" name=
"xd21e8143src">15</a> They may be broadly divided into two classes, (1)
those that wear the sacred thread, and (2) those that do not wear the
same. Adikal, Ch&#257;kkiyar, Nambiyar or Pushpakan, and Tiyy&#257;ttu
Nambiyar belong to the threaded class, while Ch&#257;kkiyar, Nambiyar,
Pish&#257;roti, V&#257;riyar, Puthuv&#257;l, and M&#257;rar are
non-threaded. Though all Ambalav&#257;sis have to do service in
temples, they have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31"
name="pb31">31</a>]</span>many of them sufficiently distinct functions
to perform. They are all governed by the marumakkath&#257;yam law of
inheritance (through the female line); some castes among them, however,
follow the makkath&#257;yam system (from father to son). A Nambiyar,
Pish&#257;roti, or V&#257;riyar marries under special circumstances a
woman of his own caste, and brings home his wife into the family, and
their issue thus become members of the father&rsquo;s family, with the
right of inheriting the family property, and form themselves into a
fresh marumakkath&#257;yam stock. In the matter of t&#257;li-kettu
(t&#257;li-tying) marriage, and marriage by union in sambandham
(alliance), they follow customs similar to those of N&#257;yars. So far
as the employment of Br&#257;hman as priests, and the period of birth
and death pollution are concerned, there are slight differences. The
threaded classes have G&#257;yatri (hymn). The purificatory ceremony
after birth or death pollution is performed by Namb&#363;dris, but at
all funeral ceremonies, such as pinda, sr&#257;dha, etc., their own
caste men officiate as priests. The Namb&#363;dris can take meals
cooked by a Br&#257;hman in the house of any of the Ambalav&#257;sis
except M&#257;rars. In fact, if the Namb&#363;dris have the right of
purification, they do not then impose any restrictions in regard to
this. All Ambalav&#257;sis are strict vegetarians at public feasts. The
Ambalav&#257;sis sit together at short distances from one another, and
take their meals. Their females unite themselves in sambandham with
their own caste males, or with Br&#257;hmans or Kshatriyas.
Br&#257;hmans, Kshatriyas, or Nambidis cannot take water from them.
Though a great majority of the Ambalav&#257;sis still follow their
traditional occupations, many of them have entered the public service,
and taken to more lucrative pursuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more important sections of the Ambalav&#257;sis are dealt with
in special articles. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32"

<p><b>Ambattan.&mdash;</b>For the following note I am indebted to Mr.
C. Hayavadana Rao. The Ambattans are the Tamil barbers, or
barber-surgeons. The word is usually derived from the Sanskrit amba
(near) and s&rsquo;tha (to stand), <i>i.e.</i>, he who stands near to
shave his clients, or treat his patients. In like manner, the
K&#257;vutiyan caste of Malay&#257;lam barbers is called Adutt&#333;n,
signifying bystander. The Ambattan corresponds to the Mangala of the
Telugu country, the Vilakkat&#257;lavan of Malabar, the Kshauraka of
the Canarese Br&#257;hmans, and the Haj&#257;m of Muhammadans. Not
improbably the name refers to the original occupation of medicine-man,
to which were added later the professions of village barber and
musician. This view seems to receive some support from the current
tradition that the Ambattans are the descendants of the offspring of a
Vaisya woman by a Br&#257;hman, to whom the medical profession was
allotted as a means of livelihood. In this connection, it may be noted
that the Ambattan women are the recognised midwives of the Hindu
community in the Tamil country. It is impossible to say how far the
above tradition is based on the verse of Manu, the ancient law-giver,
who says that &ldquo;from a Br&#257;hmana with the daughter of a Vaisya
is born a son called an Ambashtha.&rdquo; In a succeeding verse, he
states that as children of a Br&#257;hmana by a woman of one of the
three lower castes, the Ambashthas are one of the six base-born castes
or apasada. He says further that Br&#257;hmans may eat of a
barber&rsquo;s food&mdash;a permission which, it is hardly necessary to
say, they do not avail themselves of. A single exception is, however,
noteworthy. At the temple of Jugganath, within the temple precincts,
neither the barber, nor the food which he prepares, and is partaken of
by the higher classes, including Br&#257;hmans, conveys pollution. The
p&#363;j&#257;ri, or officiating priest, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>at this famous temple is
a barber, and Br&#257;hmans, except those of the extreme orthodox
section, partake of his preparations of rice, after they have been
offered to the presiding deity. This is, apparently, the only case in
which the rule laid down by Manu is followed in practice. It is not
known how far the text of Manu is answerable for the popular Sanskrit
saying, which calls the barber a &ldquo;good S&#363;dra.&rdquo; There
is an opinion entertained in certain quarters that originally the
barber&rsquo;s touch did not pollute, but that his shaving did. It is
an interesting fact that, though the Ambattans are one of Manu&rsquo;s
base-born castes, whose touch causes pollution which requires the
pouring of water over the head to remove it, they are one of the most
Brahmanised of the lower castes. Nothing, perhaps, shows this so well
as their marriage ceremonies, throughout which a Br&#257;hman
officiates. On the first two days, h&#333;mam or sacred fire, fed with
gh&#299; (clarified butter) is kindled. On the third day, the t&#257;li
(marriage badge) is placed in a circular silver or brass thattu (dish),
and touched with the forefinger of the right hand first by the
presiding Br&#257;hman, followed by other Br&#257;hmans, men of
superior castes, and the caste-men headed by the Perithanakk&#257;ran
or head-man. It is then, amid weird music, tied to the bride&rsquo;s
neck before the sacred fire. During this ceremony no widows may be
present. The relations of the bride and bridegroom scatter rice on the
floor in front of the bridal pair, after the Br&#257;hman priest and
head-man. This rice, which is called s&#275;sham (remainder), is
strictly the perquisite of the local washerman. But it is generally
purchased by the headman of the family, in which the marriage is taking
place, and handed over, not to the washerman, but to the
Perithanakk&#257;ran. The Br&#257;hman receives as his fee money and a
pair of silk-bordered cloths; and, till the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>latter
are given to him, he usually refuses to pronounce the necessary mantras
(prayers). He also receives the first p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri (betel
leaves and areca nuts), plantains, and cocoanuts. Each day he has to
get rid of the pollution caused by entering a barber&rsquo;s house by
bathing. During the fourth and fifth days, h&#333;mam is burnt, and
shadangu, or merry-making between the bride and bridegroom before the
assembled spectators, takes place, during which the bride sings songs,
in which she has been coached from infancy. On the fifth day the
removal of the kankanam, or threads which have been tied round the
wrists of the bride and bridegroom, is performed, after the
priest&rsquo;s account has been settled.</p>
<p>Among the Konga Vell&#257;las of the Salem district, it is the
Ambattan who officiates at the marriage rites, and ties the t&#257;li,
after formally proclaiming to those present that he is about to do so.
Br&#257;hmans are invited to the wedding, and are treated with due
respect, and presented with money, rice, and betel. It would appear
that, in this case, the Br&#257;hman has been ousted, in recent times,
from his priestly functions by the Ambattan. The barber, when he ties
the t&#257;li, mutters something about Br&#257;hman and V&#275;das in a
respectful manner. The story goes that, during the days of the
Ch&#275;ra, Ch&#333;la, and P&#257;ndya Kings, a Br&#257;hman and an
Ambattan were both invited to a marriage feast. But the Br&#257;hman,
on his arrival, died, and the folk, believing his death to be an evil
omen, ruled that, as the Br&#257;hman was missing, they would have an
Ambattan; and it has ever since been the custom for the Ambattan to
officiate at weddings.</p>
<p>A girl, when she reaches puberty, has to observe pollution for
eleven days, during which she bathes daily, and is presented with a new
cloth, and adorned by a girl who is said to have &ldquo;touched&rdquo;
her. This girl has to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35"
name="pb35">35</a>]</span>bathe before she can take her meals, or touch
others. Every morning, a dose of pure gingelly (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Sesamum indicum</i>) oil, mixed with white of egg, is
administered. The dietary must be strictly vegetarian. On the twelfth
day, the girl who has been through the ceremonial has a final bath, and
enters the house after it has been purified
(puny&#257;v&#257;chanam).</p>
<p>The rule, once a widow always a widow, is as true of Ambattans as of
high-class Br&#257;hmans. And, if asked whether the remarriage of
widows is permitted, they promptly reply that they are not
washermen.</p>
<p>The dead are cremated, with the exception of young children, who are
buried. The death ceremonies are conducted by a Br&#257;hman priest,
who is remunerated for his services with money and a cloth. Gifts of
money and cloths are also made to other Br&#257;hmans, when the days of
pollution are over. Annual memorial ceremonies (sr&#257;dh) are
performed, as by Br&#257;hmans. It is a privilege (they consider it as
such) of the Ambattans to cremate the bodies of village paupers other
than Br&#257;hmans. And, on ordinary occasions of death, they lead the
son or person who is entitled to light the funeral pyre, with a brass
pot in their hands, round the corpse, and indicate with a burning
cinder the place to which the light must be applied.</p>
<p>As a community the Ambattans are divided into Saivites and
Vaishnavites. Members of the latter section, who have been branded by
their Br&#257;hman guru with the chank and chakram, abstain from animal
food, and intoxicating drinks. Intermarriage between the two sections
is allowed, and commonly practised. They belong to the right-hand
faction, and will not eat with K&#333;matis, who belong to the left.
They have, however, no objection to shaving K&#333;matis. The Ambattans
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>the Chingleput district are divided into four
sections, each of which is controlled by a Perithanakk&#257;ran. One of
these resides in Madras, and the other three live respectively at
Poonamallee, Chingleput, and Karunguzhi in the Madurantakam t&#257;luk
of the Chingleput district. Ambattans are now-a-days found over the
whole Tamil area of the Madras Presidency. Originally, free movement
into the various parts of the Presidency was far from easy, and every
Ambattan, wherever he might migrate to, retained his subjection to the
chief or headman of his native village. Thus, perhaps, what was at
first a tribal division gradually developed into a territorial one.
Each Perithanakk&#257;ran has under him six hundred, or even a thousand
Kudithalakk&#257;rans, or heads of families. His office being
hereditary, he is, if only a minor, treated with respect and dignity.
All the preliminaries of marriage are arranged by him. On important
occasions, such as settling disputes, he is assisted by a
panch&#257;yat, or council of elders. In this way are settled quarrels,
questions arising out of adultery, or non-payment of fines, which it is
his duty to collect. He is further responsible for the marriage
rice-money, which is added to a communal tax of 2&frac12; annas per
family, which is imposed annually for charitable purposes. The
charities take the form of the maintenance of chattrams, or places
where pilgrims are fed free of charge at holy places. Two such
institutions are maintained in the Chingleput district, the centre of
the Ambattan community, one at Tiruppor&#363;r, the other at
Tirukalikundram. At these places Br&#257;hmans are given free meals,
and to other caste Hindus sad&#257;b&#257;th, or things necessary for
meals, are presented. Sometimes the money is spent in building adjuncts
to holy shrines. At Sr&#299;rangam, for example, the Ambattans, in days
gone by, built a fine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37"
name="pb37">37</a>]</span>stone mantapam for the local temple. If the
Perithanakk&#257;ran cannot satisfactorily dispose of a case with the
assistance of the usual panch&#257;yat (council), it is referred to the
higher authority of the Kavarai or Des&#257;i Setti, or even to British
Courts as a last resource.</p>
<p>The barber has been summed up by a district official<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8184src" href="#xd21e8184" name=
"xd21e8184src">16</a> as &ldquo;one of the most useful of the village
servants. He leads an industrious life, his services being in demand on
all occasions of marriages, feasts, and funerals. He often combines in
himself the three useful vocations of hair-dresser, surgeon, and
musician. In the early hours of the morning, he may be seen going his
rounds to his employers&rsquo; houses in his capacity of shaver and
hair-cutter. Later on, he will be leading the village band of musicians
before a wedding procession, or playing at a temple ceremony. Yet again
he may be observed paying his professional visits as Vythian or
physician, with his knapsack of surgical instruments and cutaneous
drugs tucked under his arm. By long practice the barber becomes a
fairly skilful operator with the knife, which he uses in a rough and
ready manner. He lances ulcers and carbuncles, and even essays his hand
in affections of the eye, often with the most disastrous results. It is
the barber who takes away cricks and sprains, procures leeches for
those wishing to be bled, and otherwise relieves the physical ills of
his patients. The barber woman, on the other hand, is the accoucheuse
and midwife of the village matrons. It may be said without exaggeration
that many of the uterine ailments which furnish patients to the
maternity wards of the various hospitals in this country are
attributable to the rude treatment of the village midwife.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Ambattan will cut the nails, and shave not only the head and
face, but other parts of the body, whereas the Telugu barber will shave
only down to the waist. The depilatory operations on women are
performed by female hair-dressers. Barbers&rsquo; sons are taught to
shave by taking the bottom of an old well-burnt clay cooking-pot, and,
with a blunt knife, scraping off the collected carbon. They then
commence to operate on pubescent youths. The barber who shaves
Europeans must not be a caste barber, but is either a Muhammadan or a
non-caste man. Quite recently, a youthful Ambattan had to undergo
ceremonial purification for having unconsciously shaved a Paraiyan.
Paraiyans, M&#257;las, and other classes of the lower orders, have
their own barbers and washermen. Razors are, however, sometime lent to
them by the Ambattans for a small consideration, and cleansed in water
when they are returned. Parasitic skin diseases are said to originate
from the application of a razor, which has been used on a number of
miscellaneous individuals. And well-to-do Hindus now keep their own
razor, which the barber uses when he comes to shave them. In the
southern districts, it is not usual for the Ambattans to go to the
houses of their customers, but they have sheds at the backs of their
own houses, where they attend to them from daybreak till about mid-day.
Occasionally, when sent for, they will wait on Br&#257;hmans and
high-class non-Br&#257;hmans at their houses. Numbers of them, besides,
wait for customers near the riverside. Like the English hair-cutter,
the Ambattan is a chatter-box, retails the petty gossip of the station,
and is always posted in the latest local news and scandal. The barbers
attached to British regiments are migratory, and, it is said, have
friends and connections in all military cantonments, with whom they
exchange news, and hold social <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39"
href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>intercourse. The Ambattan fills
the r&ocirc;le of negotiator and go-between in the arrangement of
marriages, feasts, and funeral. He is, moreover, the village physician
and surgeon, and, in the days when blood-letting was still in vogue,
the operation of phlebotomy was part of his business. In modern times,
his nose has, like that of the village potter, been put out of joint by
civil hospitals and dispensaries. His medicines consist of pills made
from indigenous drugs, the nature of which he does not reveal. His
surgical instrument is the razor which he uses for shaving, and he does
not resort to it until local applications, <i>e.g.</i>, in a case of
carbuncle, have failed.</p>
<p>In return for his multifarious services to the villagers, the
Ambattan was given a free grant of land, for which he has even now to
pay only a nominal tax. But, in the days when there was no survey or
settlement, if the barber neglected his duties, he was threatened with
confiscation of his lands. At the present day, however, he can sell,
mortgage, or make a gift thereof. As the Ambattans became divided up
into a number of families, their duties in the village were parcelled
out among them, so that each barber family became attached to certain
families of other castes, and was entitled to certain rights from them.
Among other claims, each barber family became entitled to three or four
marakk&#257;ls of paddy (unhusked rice), which is the perquisite of the
married members thereof. It may be noted that, in village communities,
lands were granted not only to the barber, but also to village
officials such as the blacksmith, carpenter, washerman, astrologer,
priest, dancing-girl, etc.</p>
<p>In his capacity of barber, the Ambattan is called N&#257;sivan
(unholy man), or, according to the Census Reports, N&#257;suvan (sprung
from the nose), or N&#257;vidan. He is also known as Panditan or
Pariy&#257;ri (doctor), and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href=
"#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>Kudimaghan (son of the ryot). The
last of these names is applied to him especially on occasions of
marriage, when to call him N&#257;sivan would be inauspicious. The
recognised insigne of his calling is the small looking-glass, which he
carries with him, together with the razor, and sometimes tweezers and
ear-pick. He must salute his superiors by prostrating himself on his
stomach, folding his arms, and standing at a respectful distance. He
may not attend at Br&#257;hman houses on new or full-moon days,
Tuesday, Saturday, and special days such as Ek&#257;dasi and
Dw&#257;dasi. The most proper days are Sunday and Monday. The quality
of the shave varies with the skill of the individual, and there is a
Tamil proverb &ldquo;Go to an old barber and a new washerman.&rdquo;
Stories are extant of barbers shaving kings while they were asleep
without waking them, and it is said that the last R&#257;ja of Tanjore
used to be thus entertained with exhibitions of their skill. The old
legend of the barber who, in return for shaving a R&#257;ja without
awakening him, requested that he might be made a Br&#257;hman, and how
the Court jester Tenn&#257;li R&#257;man got the R&#257;ja to cancel
his agreement, has recently been re-told in rhyme.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e8201src" href="#xd21e8201" name="xd21e8201src">17</a> It is
there described how the barber lathered the head &ldquo;with water
alone, for soap he had none.&rdquo; The modern barber, however, uses
soap, either a cheap quality purchased in the bazar, or a more
expensive brand supplied by his client.</p>
<p>By a curious corruption, Hamilton&rsquo;s bridge, which connects the
Triplicane and Mylapore divisions of the city of Madras, has become
converted into Ambattan, or barber&rsquo;s bridge. And the barber, as
he shaves you, will tell how, in days before the bridge was built, the
channel became unfordable during a north-east monsoon flood.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>A barber, who lived on the Triplicane side, had to
shave an engineer, whose house was on the Mylapore side. With
difficulty he swam across, and shaved the sahib while he was asleep
without waking him, and, in return, asked that, in the public
interests, a bridge should be built over the channel.</p>
<p><b>Ambattans of Travancore.&mdash;</b>For the following note I am
indebted to Mr. N. Subramani Aiyer. The barbers of Travancore are
called by various designations, those in Central and South Travancore
preferring to be known by the name of Kshaurakan or Kshaurakk&#257;ran,
a corruption of the Sanskrit kshuraka, while Ambattan seems to find
general favour in the south. A curious name given to the caste
throughout Travancore is Pr&#257;nopak&#257;ri, or one who helps the
souls, indicating their priestly functions in the ceremonials of
various castes. A contraction of this name found in the early
settlement records is Pr&#257;nu. The members of those families from
which kings and noblemen have at any time selected their barbers are
called Vilakkittalavan, or more properly Vilakkuttalayan, meaning
literally those who shave heads. In North Travancore many families are
in possession of royal edicts conferring upon them the title of
Panikkar, and along with it the headmanship of the barber families of
the village in which they reside. Others have the title of Vaidyan or
doctor, from the secondary occupation of the caste.</p>
<p>Endless endogamous septs occur among the barbers, and, at
Trivandrum, there are said to be four varieties called Chala Vazhi,
P&#257;ndi Vazhi, Attungal Vazhi, and Peruntanni Vazhi. But it is
possible to divide all the Kshaurakans of Travancore into three
classes, viz., Malay&#257;lam-speaking Ambattans, who follow the
makkath&#257;yam law of inheritance; (2) Malay&#257;lam-speaking
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>Ambattans who follow the marumakkath&#257;yam law
of inheritance; (3) Tamil-speaking barbers, who have in many localities
adopted Malay&#257;lam as their mother-tongue, and indicate their
recent conversion in this direction by preserving unchanged the dress
and ornaments of their womenkind. In Pattanap&#363;ram, for example,
there is a class of Malay&#257;lam-speaking barbers known as
P&#363;l&#257;ns who immigrated into that taluk from the Tamil country
about two hundred years ago, and reveal their kinship with the
Tamil-speaking barbers in various ways. In Kottayam and some other
North Travancore t&#257;luks, a large number of barbers may be
described as recent converts of this character. In theory at least, the
makkath&#257;yam and marumakkath&#257;yam Ambattans may be said to form
two distinct endogamous groups, of which the former regard themselves
as far superior to the latter in social position. Sometimes the
makkath&#257;yam Ambattans give their girls in marriage to the
marumakkath&#257;yam Ambattans, though the converse can never hold
good. But, in these cases, the girl is not permitted to re-enter the
paternal home, and associate with the people therein.</p>
<p>A local tradition describes the Travancore Kshaurakans as pursuing
their present occupation owing to the curse of Surabhi, the divine
calf. Whatever their origin, they have faithfully followed their
traditional occupation, and, in addition, many study medicine in their
youth, and attend to the ailments of the villagers, while the women act
as midwives. When a high-caste Hindu dies, the duty of supplying the
fuel for the funeral pyre, and watching the burning ground, devolves on
the barber.</p>
<p>In their dress and ornaments the Travancore barbers closely resemble
the N&#257;yars, but some wear round gold beads and a conch-shaped
marriage jewel round the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=
"#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>neck, to distinguish their women from
those of the N&#257;yars. This, however, does not hold good in South
Travancore, where the women have entirely adopted the N&#257;yar type
of jewelry. Tattooing prevails to a greater extent among the barbers
than among other classes, but has begun to lose its popularity.</p>
<p>The barbers not only worship the ordinary Hindu deities, but also
adore such divinities as Murti, M&#257;den, and Yakshi. The corpses of
those who die as the result of accident or contagious disease, are
buried, not burnt. A sorcerer is called on to raise the dead from the
grave, and, at his instance, a kuryala or small thatched shed is
erected, to provide a sanctum for the resurrected spirit. Every year,
in the month of Makaram (January-February), the day on which the
Utradam star falls is taken as the occasion for making offerings to
these spirits.</p>
<p>In every village certain families had bestowed on them by the
chieftains of K&#275;rala the right of deciding all questions affecting
the caste. All social offences are tried by them, and the decision
takes the form of an order to celebrate ianang&#363;ttu or feast of the
equals, at which the first article served on the leaf placed before the
assembled guests is not food, but a sum of money.</p>
<p>The t&#257;li-kettu and sambandham ceremonies are celebrated, the
former before, and the latter after the girl has reached puberty. The
preliminary rites of betrothal and k&#257;pu-kettu (tying the string
round the wrist) over, the bridegroom enters the marriage hall in
procession. There are no V&#275;dic rites; nor is there any definite
priest for the marriage ceremony. The conch-shell is blown at odd
intervals, this being considered indispensable. The festivities last
for four days. A niece and nephew are regarded as the most legitimate
spouses of a son and daughter respectively. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span></p>
<p>After the cremation or burial of a corpse, a rope is held by two of
the relations between the dead person&rsquo;s remains and the karta
(chief mourner), and cut in two, as if to indicate that all connection
between the karta and the deceased has ceased. This is called bandham
aruppu, or severing of connection. Pollution lasts for sixteen days
among all sections of the barbers, except the Tamils, who regain their
purity after a death in the family on the eleventh day.</p>

Raut is frequently a title of headmen among Ling&#257;yats.</p>
<p><b>&#256;ndi.&mdash;</b>In a note on &#256;ndis in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, Mr. W. Francis writes that &ldquo;for a Br&#257;hman or
an ascetic, mendicancy was always considered an honourable profession,
to which no sort of shame attached. Manu says &lsquo;a Br&#257;hman
should constantly shun worldly honour, as he would shun poison, and
rather constantly seek disrespect as he would seek nectar&rsquo;; and
every Br&#257;hman youth was required to spend part of his life as a
beggar. The Jains and Buddhists held the same views. The Hindu
Chattrams<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8291src" href="#xd21e8291" name=
"xd21e8291src">19</a> and Uttupuras, the Jain Pallis, and the Buddhist
Vih&#257;ras owe their origin to this attitude, they being originally
intended for the support of the mendicant members of these religions.
But persons of other than the priestly and religious classes were
expected to work for their living, and were not entitled to relief in
these institutions. Begging among such people&mdash;unless, as in the
case of the Pand&#257;rams and &#256;ndis, a religious flavour attaches
to it&mdash;is still considered disreputable. The percentage of beggars
in the Tamil districts to the total population is .97, or more than
twice what it is in the Telugu country, while in Malabar it is as low
as .09. The Telugus are certainly not richer as a class than the
Tamils, and the explanation of these differences is perhaps to be found
in the fact that the south is more religiously inclined than the north,
and has more temples and their connected charities (religion and
charity go hand in hand in India), and so offers more temptation to
follow begging as a profession. &#256;ndis are Tamil beggars. They are
really inferior to Pand&#257;rams, but the two terms are in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>practice often indiscriminately applied to the
same class of people. Pand&#257;rams are usually Vell&#257;las by
caste, but &#256;ndis are recruited from all classes of S&#363;dras,
and they consequently have various sub-divisions, which are named after
the caste to which the members of each originally belonged, such as the
Jangam &#256;ndis, meaning beggars of the Jangam caste, and the
J&#333;gi &#256;ndis, that is, &#256;ndis of the J&#333;gi caste. They
also have occupational and other divisions, such as the K&#333;vil
&#256;ndis, meaning those who do service in temples, and the
Mudav&#257;ndis or the lame beggars. &#256;ndi is in fact almost a
generic term. All &#256;ndis are not beggars however; some are
bricklayers, others are cultivators, and others are occupied in the
temples. They employed Br&#257;hman priests at their ceremonies, but
all of them eat meat and drink alcohol. Widows and divorc&eacute;es may
marry again. Among the Tinnevelly &#256;ndis, the sister of the
bridegroom ties the t&#257;li (marriage badge) round the bride&rsquo;s
neck, <span class="corr" id="xd21e8296" title=
"Source: whch">which</span> is not usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1891, the &#256;ndis are summed up as
&ldquo;beggars who profess the Saiva faith. They may be found in all
the Tamil districts, begging from door to door, beating a small gong
with a stick. The &#256;ndis differ from most other castes, in that a
person of any caste may join their community. Some of them officiate as
priests in village temples, especially when large sacrifices of goats,
buffaloes, and pigs are made. They usually bury the dead. They have
returned 105 sub-divisions, of which the most important are the
following:&mdash;Jangam, K&#333;man&#257;ndi, Lingad&#257;ri,
Mudav&#257;ndi, and Upp&#257;ndi. K&#333;manam is the small loin cloth,
and a K&#333;man&#257;ndi goes naked, except for this slight concession
to decency. Mudam means lame, and the Mudav&#257;ndis (<i>q.v.</i>) are
allowed to claim any deformed child belonging to the Konga Vell&#257;la
caste. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>The etymology of Upp&#257;ndi is difficult, but it
is improbable that it has any connection with uppu, salt.</p>
<p>In the Tanjore Manual, it is noted that &ldquo;in its ordinary
acceptation the word &#256;ndi means houseless beggars, and is applied
to those who profess the Saiva faith. They go out every morning,
begging for alms of uncooked rice, singing ballads or hymns. They play
on a small gong called s&#275;makkalam with a stick, and often carry a
conch shell, which they blow. They are given to drinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8310src" href="#xd21e8310"
name="xd21e8310src">20</a> that &ldquo;South Indian beggars are divided
into two classes, Panjath&#257;ndi and Paramparai&#257;ndi. The former
are famine-made beggars, and the latter are beggars from generation to
generation. The former, a common saying goes, would rob from the person
of a child at a convenient opportunity, while the latter would jump
into a well, and pick up a child which had fallen into it by an
accident, and make it over to its parents.&rdquo;</p>

Lablab</i>).&mdash;An exogamous sept of D&#275;v&#257;nga. The

<p><b>Anuppan.&mdash;</b>The Anuppans are described, in the Madras
Census Report, 1891, as &ldquo;a small caste of Canarese farmers, found
chiefly in the districts of Madura, Tinnevelly, and Coimbatore. Their
original home appears to have been Mysore or South Canara, probably the
former. Their language is a corrupt form of Canarese. The most
important sub-division is Allikulam (lily clan). Some of them are
Saivites, and others Vaishnavites. Br&#257;hmans are employed as
priests by the Vaishnavites, but not by the Saivites. Remarriage of
widows is practised, but a woman divorced for adultery cannot remarry
during the life-time of her husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Gazetteer of the Madura district, it is stated that
&ldquo;the Anuppans are commonest in the Kambam valley. They have a
tradition regarding their migration thither, which closely resembles
that current among the K&#257;ppiliyans and Tottiyans (<i>q.v.</i>).
Local tradition at Kambam says that the Anuppans were in great strength
here in olden days, and that quarrels arose, in the course of which the
chief of the K&#257;ppiliyans, R&#257;machcha Kavandan, was killed.
With his dying breath he cursed the Anuppans, and thenceforth they
never prospered, and now not one of them is left in the town. Their
title is Kavandan. They are divided into six territorial groups called
M&#275;dus, which are named after three villages in this district, and
three in Tinnevelly. Over each of these is a headman called the
Periyadanakk&#257;ran, and the three former are also subject to a Guru
who lives at Sirup&#257;lai near Madura. These three are divided again
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>into eighteen kilais or branches, each of which
intermarries only with certain of the others. Caste panch&#257;yats
(councils) are held on a blanket, on which (compare the Tottiyan
custom) is placed a pot of water containing margosa (<i>Melia
Azadirachta</i>) leaves, to symbolise the sacred nature of the meeting.
Women who go astray with men of other castes are expelled, and various
ceremonies, including (it is said) the burying alive of a goat, are
enacted to show that they are dead to the community. The right of a man
to his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter is as vigorously maintained as
among the K&#257;ppiliyans and Tottiyans, and leads to the same curious
state of affairs (<i>i.e.</i>, a woman, whose husband is too young to
fulfil the duties of his position, is allowed to consort with his near
relations, and the children so begotten are treated as his). No
t&#257;li (marriage badge) is tied at weddings, and the binding part of
the ceremonies is the linking, on seven separate occasions, of the
little fingers of the couple. Like the K&#257;ppiliyans, the Anuppans
have many caste and family deities, a number of whom are women who
committed sati.&rdquo; (<i>See</i> K&#257;ppiliyan).</p>
<p><b>Apoto.&mdash;</b>Apoto, or Oppoto, is a sub-division of Gaudos,
the occupation of which is palanquin-bearing.</p>
<p><b>Appa</b> (father).&mdash;A title of members of various Telugu and
Canarese castes, <i>e.g.</i>, &#298;diga, Kannadiyan, Linga Balija, and
Tambala.</p>
<p><b>Arab.&mdash;</b>A Muhammadan territorial name, returned at times
of census. In the Mysore Census Report, 1901, the Arabs are described
as itinerant tradesmen, whose chief business is horse-dealing, though
some deal in cloths.</p>
<p><b>&#256;r&#257;dhya.&mdash;</b>For the following note I am indebted
to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The &#256;r&#257;dhyas are a sect of
Br&#257;hmans found mainly in the four northern districts of the Madras
Presidency, and to a smaller extent in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>Cuddapah
and Kurnool districts. A few are also found in the Mysore State. They
differ in almost every important respect from other Br&#257;hmans.
Basava, the founder of the Ling&#257;yat religion, was born in a family
of Br&#257;hmans, who, with others round about them, were apparently
the first converts to his religion. According to Mr. C. P.
Brown,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8436src" href="#xd21e8436" name=
"xd21e8436src">22</a> they were &ldquo;in all probability his personal
friends; he persuaded them to lay aside their name, and call themselves
&#256;r&#257;dhya or Reverend.&rsquo; They revere the four
&#256;r&#257;dhyas, visionary personages of the Ling&#257;yat creed, of
whom very little is known. At all social and religious functions,
birth, marriage, initiation and funerals, four vases of water are
solemnly placed in their name, and then invoked to preside over them.
Their names are R&#275;van&#257;r&#257;dhya, Marul&#257;r&#257;dhya,
Ekor&#257;mar&#257;dhya, and Pandit&#257;r&#257;dhya. In four ages, it
is said, these four successively appeared as precursors of the divine
Basava, and were, like Basava, Br&#257;hmans. A Pur&#257;na, known as
the Pandit&#257;r&#257;dhya Charitra, is named after the last of these.
Versions thereof are found both in Canarese and Telugu. A Sanskrit
poem, called Siddh&#257;nta Sikh&#257;mani, represents
R&#275;van&#257;r&#257;dhya as a human manifestation of one of the
ministers of Siva.</p>
<p>As might be expected, the members of this sect are staunch Saivites.
They wear both the Br&#257;hminical sacred thread, and the linga
suspended from another thread. They revere in particular Ganapathi. The
lingam which they wear they usually call the pr&#257;na lingam, or life
lingam. The moment a child, male or female, is born, it is invested
with the lingam; otherwise it is not considered to have pr&#257;nam or
life. The popular belief is that, if by some accident the lingam is
lost, a man must either fast <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>until he recovers it, or not survive
so dire a calamity. This is a fixed dogma with them. A man who loses
his pr&#257;na linga stands up to his neck in water, and repeats
mantrams (sacred formul&aelig;) for days together; and, on the last
day, the lost lingam comes back to him miraculously, if he has been
really orthodox in his life. If he does not succeed in recovering it,
he must starve and die. The theory is that the lingam is the life of
the man who wears it, and, when it is lost beyond recovery, he loses
his own life. Incredible stories of miraculous recoveries of the lingam
are told. In one case, it is said to have returned to its owner, making
a loud noise in water; and in another it was found in a box under lock
and key. In this connection, the following story is narrated by Colonel
Wilks.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8443src" href="#xd21e8443" name=
"xd21e8443src">23</a> &ldquo;Poornia, the present minister of Mysore,
relates an incident of a Ling&#257;yat friend of his, who had unhappily
lost his portable God, and came to take a last farewell. The Indians,
like more enlightened nations, readily laugh at the absurdities of
every sect but their own, and Poornia gave him better counsel. It is a
part of the ceremonial preceding the sacrifice of the individual that
the principal persons of the sect should assemble on the bank of some
holy stream, and, placing in a basket the lingam images of the whole
assembly, purify them in the sacred waters. The destined victim in
conformity to the advice of his friend, suddenly seized the basket, and
overturned its contents into the rapid Caveri. Now, my friends, said
he, we are on equal terms; let us prepare to die together. The
discussion terminated according to expectation. The whole party took an
oath of inviolable secrecy, and each privately provided himself with a
new image of the lingam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#256;r&#257;dhyas, as has been indicated, differ from other
Br&#257;hmans in general in some of their customs. Before they partake
of food, they make an offering of it to the lingam which they are
wearing. As they cannot eat without making this offering, they have the
entire meal served up at the commencement thereof. They offer the whole
to the lingam, and then begin to eat. They do not accept offerings
distributed in temples as other Br&#257;hmans do, because they have
already been offered to the God, and cannot therefore be offered again
to the lingam. Unlike other Ling&#257;yats, &#256;r&#257;dhyas believe
in the V&#275;das, to which they give allegorical interpretations. They
are fond of reading Sanskrit, and a few have been well-known Telugu
poets. Thus, P&#257;lap&#363;ri S&#333;man&#257;tha, who lived in the
fourteenth century A.D., composed the Basava Pur&#257;na and the
Pandit&#257;r&#257;dhya Charitra, and the brothers Piduparthi
S&#333;man&#257;tha and the Basavakavi, who lived in the sixteenth
century, composed other religious works.</p>
<p>&#256;r&#257;dhyas marry among themselves, and occasionally take
girls in marriage from certain of the Niy&#333;gi sub-divisions of the
Northern Circars. This would seem to show that they were themselves
Niy&#333;gis, prior to their conversion. They do not intermarry with
&#256;ruv&#275;lu Niy&#333;gis. Unlike other Br&#257;hmans, they bury
their dead in a sitting posture. They observe death pollution for ten
days, and perform the ekodishta and other Br&#257;hminical ceremonies
for their progenitors. They perform annually, not the Br&#257;hminical
sr&#257;dha, but the &#257;r&#257;dhana. In the latter, there is no
apasavyam (wearing the sacred thread from right to left), and no use of
gingelly seeds and dharba grass. Nor is there h&#333;mam (raising the
sacrificial fire), parv&#257;nam (offering of rice-balls), or oblation
of water. Widows do not have their heads shaved. <span class=

<p><b>Arakala.&mdash;</b>A small class of cultivators, recorded mainly

an exogamous sept of D&#275;v&#257;nga. In Southern India, turmeric
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Curcuma</i>) is commonly called saffron (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Crocus</i>). Turmeric enters largely into Hindu ceremonial.
For example, the practice of smearing the face with it is very
widespread among females, and, thinking that it will give their
husbands increase of years, women freely bathe themselves with turmeric
water. The use of water, in which turmeric has been infused, and by
which they give the whole body a bright yellow colour, is prescribed to
wives as a mark of the conjugal state, and forbidden to
widows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8489src" href="#xd21e8489" name=
"xd21e8489src">24</a> To ward off the evil eye, a vessel containing
turmeric water and other things is waved in front of the bridal couple
at weddings. Or they are bathed in turmeric water, which they pour over
each other. The t&#257;li or bottu (gold marriage badge) is attached to
a cotton thread dyed with turmeric, and, among some castes, the tying
together of the hands of the bride and bridegroom with such a thread is
the binding portion of the ceremony. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

connected with the R&#257;jahs of Mysore. During the life-time of the
late Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, they were divided into two factions in
consequence of the refusal of thirteen families headed by the Dalavayi
(the chief of the female branch) to pay respect to an illegitimate son
of His Highness. The other eighteen families consented to the
R&#257;jah&rsquo;s wishes, and treat the illegitimate branch, called
Komarapatta, as equals. The two divisions intermarry and eat together,
and the family quarrel, though serious at the time, is not likely to be
permanent. They are employed chiefly under Government and in
agriculture, most of the former being engaged in the palace at Mysore.
R&#257;jpindes are both Vishnavites and Sivites, and their priests are
both Br&#257;hmans and Ling&#257;yat Waders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1891, Arasu (= R&#257;ja or king) is

<p><b>Arava.&mdash;</b>Arava, signifying Tamil, has been recorded as a
sub-division of some Telugu classes, <i>e.g.</i>, Golla and Velama. The
name, however, refers to Tamil Idaiyans and Vell&#257;las, who have
settled in the Telugu country, and are known respectively as Arava
Golla and Arava Velama. In some places in the Telugu country, Tamil
Paraiyans, employed as servants under Europeans, horse-keepers, etc.,
are known as Arava M&#257;lalu (M&#257;las). The <span class=

of the North Arcot district are, in like manner, sometimes called Arava
Y&#257;n&#257;dis. Arava also occurs as a division of Tigalas, said to
be a section of the Tamil Pallis, who have settled in Mysore. An
ingenious suggestion has been made that Arava is derived from ara,
half, vayi, mouthed, in reference to the defective Tamil alphabet, or
to the termination of the words being mostly in consonants.</p>

<p><b>&#256;r&#275;.&mdash;</b>A synonym for Mar&#257;thi. The name
occurs as a sub-division of Kunchigar and Kudubi. In South Canara
&#256;rya Kshatri occurs as the equivalent of &#256;r&#275;, and, in
the Telugu country, &#256;r&#275; K&#257;pu refers to Mar&#257;thi
cultivators. &#256;rya K&#363;tt&#257;di is a Tamil synonym of
Mar&#257;thi Dommaras. Concerning the &#256;r&#275;s, Mr. H. G. Stuart
writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8541src" href=
"#xd21e8541" name="xd21e8541src">26</a> &ldquo;Of the total number of
6,809 &#256;r&#275;s, 4,373 are found in South Canara, Bellary and
Anantapur, and these are true &#256;r&#275;s. Of the rest I am not able
to speak with certainty, as the term &#256;rya, which is a synonym of
&#256;r&#275;, is also used as an equivalent of Mar&#257;thi, and
sometimes in a still wider sense. The true &#256;r&#275;s are
husbandmen of Mar&#257;tha origin. They wear the sacred thread, have
Br&#257;hmans as their priests, and give allegiance to the head of the
Sring&#275;ri Mutt. Marriage of girls takes place either before or
after puberty, and the remarriage of widows is not allowed. A husband
may divorce his wife for adultery, but a wife <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>cannot
divorce her husband. When the guilt of a woman is proved, and the
sanction of the Guru obtained, the husband performs the act of divorce
by cutting a pumpkin in two at a place where three ways meet. The use
of animal food is allowed, but intoxicating liquors are
forbidden.&rdquo; The &#256;r&#275;s of South Canara, Mr. Stuart writes
further,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8546src" href="#xd21e8546" name=
"xd21e8546src">27</a> &ldquo;usually speak Mar&#257;thi or Konkani, but
in the K&#257;sarag&#333;d t&#257;luk, and possibly in other parts too,
they speak Canarese. Their exogamous septs are called manathanas. They
use the dh&#257;re form of marriage (<i>see</i> Bant), but the pot
contains a mixture of water, milk, ghee (clarified butter), honey and
curds instead of the usual plain water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mar&#257;thi-speaking Ar&#275;yavaru or Aryavaru of the South
Canara district follow the makkala sant&#257;na law of inheritance
(from father to son). For ceremonial purposes, they engage Shivalli
Br&#257;hmans. An interesting feature of the marriage rites is that the
bridegroom makes a pretence of going to a battle-field to fight,
presumably to show that he is of Kshatriya descent. The ceremony is
called dand&#257;l j&#257;tai. The bridegroom ties a bead on the neck
of the bride if of the Powar sept, and a disc if of the Edar sept. The
&#256;r&#275;yavaru eat fowls and fish. The former are killed after
certain mantrams (prayers) have been uttered, and, if a priest is
available, it is his duty to despatch the bird. The caste deity is
Amman&#333;ru (Durga), in the worship of whom the &#256;r&#275;yavaru,
like other Mar&#257;tha castes, employ Gondala mendicants.</p>

<p><b>Aruva.&mdash;</b>The Aruvas are an interesting caste of
cultivators along the sea-coast in the Berhamp&#363;r t&#257;luk of
Ganjam. They say that they are descended from the offspring of
alliances between Pat&#257;nis (Muhammadans) and Oriya women. Like
other Oriya castes, they have a number of titles, <i>e.g.</i>,
N&#257;yako, P&#257;tro, Podh&#257;no, Ponda, Mondolo, and Mollana,
some of which seem to be exogamous, and there are also numerous
exogamous septs or bamsams. The headman is styled N&#257;yako, and he
is assisted by a Bhollobhaya. Both these offices are hereditary. The
Aruvas say that they belong to two V&#275;das, viz., the males to
Atharva V&#275;da, and the females to Yajur V&#275;da. Muhammadans are
believed by them to be Atharvav&#275;dis.</p>
<p>A member of the caste, called Mollana, officiates on ceremonial
occasions. A pure Oriya casteman will not allow his son to marry his
sister&rsquo;s daughter, but this is permitted in most places by the
Aruvas. The marriage ceremonial, except in a few points of detail,
conforms to the general Oriya type. On the day before the wedding, a
milk-post of bamboo is erected, and in front of it a new cloth, and
various articles for worship are placed. When the fingers of the
contracting couple are linked together, and at other stages of the
marriage rites, the Mollana recites certain formul&aelig;, in which the
words Bismillahi and Allah occur.</p>
<p>The dead are always buried. In former days, stone slabs, with Arabic
or Hindustani legends in Oriya characters inscribed on them, used to be
set up over the grave. For these, two sticks are now substituted. The
corpse of a dead person is sewn up in a kind of sack. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>As it is
being lowered into the grave, the Mollana recites formul&aelig;, and
those present throw earth over it before the grave is filled in. They
then take their departure, and the Mollana, standing on one leg,
recites further formul&aelig;. On the following day, bitter food,
consisting of rice and margosa (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia
Azadirachta</i>) leaves, is prepared, and given to the agnates. On the
third day after death, the burial-ground is visited, and, after water
has been poured over the grave, a cloth is spread thereon. On this
relations of the deceased throw earth and food. A purificatory
ceremony, in which gh&#299; (clarified butter) is touched, is performed
on the fifteenth day. On the fortieth day, the Mollana officiates at a
ceremony in which food is offered to the dead person.</p>
<p>The Aruvas do not take part in any Muhammadan ceremonial, and do not
worship in mosques. Most of them are Paramarthos, and all worship
various Hindu deities and T&#257;kur&#257;nis (village gods). At their
houses, the god is represented by a mass of mud of conical shape, with
an areca nut on the top of it. In recent times, a number of Aruva
families, owing to a dispute with the Mollana, do not employ him for

<p><b>&#256;s&#257;di.&mdash;</b>The &#256;s&#257;dis of the Bellary
district are summed up, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=

Bellary, are almost interchangeable terms. They are prostitutes and
dancers.&rdquo; Among the M&#257;digas, men called &#256;s&#257;di, who
have undergone an initiation ceremony, go about, in company with the
M&#257;tangis (dedicated prostitutes), playing on an instrument called
the chaudike, and singing the praises and reciting the story of
Ellamm&#257;. (<i>See</i> M&#257;diga.)</p>
<p><b>&#256;san</b> (teacher).&mdash;The title of Variyans, who have
held the hereditary position of tutors in noblemen&rsquo;s families.
Also a title of Pish&#257;rati and Kanisan.</p>
<p><b>&#256;s&#257;ri.&mdash;</b>In most parts of the Madras
Presidency, Mr. H. A. Sturat writes, &ldquo;&#256;s&#257;ri (or
&#256;ch&#257;ri) is synonymous with Kamm&#257;lan, and may denote any
of the five artizan castes, but in Malabar it is practically confined
to the carpenter caste. The &#256;s&#257;ri of Malabar is the
Br&#257;hman of the Kamm&#257;la castes. The Kamm&#257;la castes
generally pollute N&#257;yars by approaching within twelve feet, and
Br&#257;hmans by coming within thirty-six feet; but an &#256;s&#257;ri
with his measuring rod in his hand has the privilege of approaching
very near, and even entering the houses of higher castes without
polluting them. This exception may have arisen out of necessity.&rdquo;
At the census, 1901, some S&#257;yakk&#257;rans (Tamil dyers) returned
&#256;s&#257;ri as a title.</p>
<p>In a Government office, a short time ago, the head clerk, a
Br&#257;hman named Rangach&#257;ri, altered the spelling of the name of
a Kamm&#257;lan from Velayudach&#257;ri to Velayudas&#257;ri in the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><b>Badaga.&mdash;</b>As the Todas are the pastoral,
and the Kotas the artisan tribe of the N&#299;lgiris, so the
agricultural element on these hills is represented by the Badagas (or,
as they are sometimes called, Burghers). Their number was returned, at
the census, 1901, as 34,178 against 1,267 Kotas, and 807 Todas. Though
the primary occupation of the Badagas is agriculture, there are among
their community schoolmasters, clerks, public works contractors,
bricklayers, painters, carpenters, sawyers, tailors, gardeners, forest
guards, barbers, washermen, and scavengers. Many work on tea and coffee
estates, and gangs of Badagas can always be seen breaking stones on,
and repairing the hill roads. Others are, at the present day, earning
good wages in the Cordite Factory near Wellington. Some of the more
prosperous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>possess tea and coffee estates of their own. The
rising generation are, to some extent, learning Tamil and English, in
addition to their own language, which is said to resemble old Canarese.
And I have heard a youthful Badaga, tending a flock of sheep, address
an errant member thereof in very fluent Billingsgate. There were, in
1904&ndash;1905, thirty-nine Badaga schools, which were attended by
1,222 pupils. In 1907, one Badaga had passed the Matriculation of the
Madras University, and was a clerk in the Sub-judge&rsquo;s Court at
Ootacamund.</p>
<p>A newspaper discussion was carried on a few years ago as to the
condition of the Badagas, and whether they are a down-trodden tribe,
bankrupt and impoverished to such a degree that it is only a short time
before something must be done to ameliorate their condition, and save
them from extermination by inducing them to emigrate to the Wyn&#257;d
and Vizagapatam. A few have, in recent years, migrated to the Anaimalai
hills, to work on the planters&rsquo; estates, which have been opened
up there. One writer stated that &ldquo;the tiled houses, costing from
Rs. 250 to Rs. 500, certainly point to their prosperity. They may
frequently borrow from the Labbai to enable them to build, but, as I do
not know of a single case in which the Labbai has ever seized the house
and sold it, I believe this debt is soon discharged. The walled-in,
terraced fields immediately around their villages, on which they grow
their barley and other grains requiring rich cultivation, are well
worked, and regularly manured. The coats, good thick blankets, and gold
ear-rings, which most Badagas now possess, can only, I think, point to
their prosperity, while their constant feasts, and disinclination to
work on Sundays, show that the loss of a few days&rsquo; pay does not
affect them. On the other hand, a former Native official on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>the N&#299;lgiris writes to me that &ldquo;though
the average Badaga is thrifty and hard-working, there is a tendency for
him to be lazy when he is sure of his meal. When a person is sick in
another village, his relatives make it an excuse to go and see him, and
they have to be fed. When the first crop is raised, the idler pretends
that &lsquo;worms&rsquo; have crept into the crop, and the gods have to
be propitiated, and there is a feast. Marriage or death, of course,
draws a crowd to be fed or feasted. All this means extra expenditure,
and a considerable drain on the slender income of the family. The
Rowthan (Muhammadan merchant) from the Tamil country is near at hand to
lend money, as he has carried his bazar to the very heart of the Badaga
villages. First it is a bag of r&#257;gi (food grain), a piece of cloth
to throw on the coffin, or a few rupees worth of rice and curry-stuff
doled out by the all-accommodating Rowthan at a price out of all
proportion to the market rate, and at a rate ranging from six pies to
two annas for the rupee. The ever impecunious Badaga has no means of
extricating himself, with a slender income, which leaves no margin for
redeeming debts. The bond is renewed every quarter or half year, and
the debt grows by leaps and bounds, and consumes all his earthly goods,
including lands. The advent of lawyers on the hills has made the
Badagas a most litigious people, and they resort to the courts, which
means expenditure of money, and neglect of agriculture.&rdquo; In the
funeral song of the Badagas, which has been translated by Mr.
Gover,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8789src" href="#xd21e8789" name=
"xd21e8789src">1</a> one of the crimes enumerated, for which atonement
must be made, is that of preferring a complaint to the Sirkar
(Government), and one of their numerous proverbs embodies the same
idea. &ldquo;If you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66"
name="pb66">66</a>]</span>prefer a complaint to a Magistrate, it is as
if you had put poison into your adversary&rsquo;s food.&rdquo; But Mr.
Grigg writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8794src" href="#xd21e8794"
name="xd21e8794src">2</a> &ldquo;either the terrors of the Sirkar are
not what they were, or this precept is much disregarded, for the
Court-house at Ootacamund is constantly thronged with Badagas, and they
are now very much given to litigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gather from the notes, which Bishop Whitehead has kindly placed at
my disposal, that &ldquo;when the Badagas wish to take a very solemn
oath, they go to the temple of M&#257;riamma at Sig&#363;r, and, after
bathing in the stream and putting on only one cloth, offer fruits,
cocoanuts, etc., and kill a sheep or fowl. They put the head of the
animal on the step of the shrine, and make a line on the ground just in
front of it. The person who is taking the oath then walks from seven
feet off in seven steps, putting one foot immediately in front of the
other, up to the line, crosses it, goes inside the shrine, and puts out
a lamp that is burning in front of the image. If the oath is true, the
man will walk without any difficulty straight to the shrine. But, if
the oath is not true, his eyes will be blinded, and he will not be able
to walk straight to the shrine, or see the lamp. It is a common saying
among Badagas, when a man tells lies, &lsquo;Will you go to Sig&#363;r,
and take an oath?&rsquo; Oaths are taken in much the same way at the
temple of M&#257;riamma at Ootacamund. When a Hindu gives evidence in
the Court at Ootacamund, he is often asked by the Judge whether he will
take an oath at the M&#257;riamma temple. If he agrees, he is sent off
to the temple with a Court official. The party for whom he gives
evidence supplies a goat or sheep, which is killed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>at the
temple, the head and carcase being placed in front of the image. The
witness steps over the carcase, and this forms the oath. If the
evidence is false, it is believed that some evil will happen to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name Badaga or Vadugan means northerner, and the Badagas are
believed to be descended from Canarese colonists from the Mysore
country, who migrated to the N&#299;lgiris three centuries ago owing to
famine, political turmoil, or local oppression in their own country. It
is worthy of notice, in this connection, that the head of the Badagas,
like that of the Todas and Kotas, is dolichocephalic, and not of the
mesaticephalic or sub-brachycephalic type, which prevails throughout
Mysore, as in other Canarese areas.</p>

<p>Concerning the origin of the Badagas, the following legend is
current. Seven brothers and their sisters were living on the Talamalai
hills. A Muhammadan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68"
name="pb68">68</a>]</span>ruler attempted to ravish the girl, whom the
brother saved from him by flight. They settled down near the present
village of Bethalhada. After a short stay there, the brothers
separated, and settled in different parts of the N&#299;lgiris, which
they peopled. Concerning the second brother, Hethappa, who had two
daughters, the story goes that, during his absence on one occasion, two
Todas forced their way into his house, ravished his wife, and possessed
themselves of his <span class="corr" id="xd21e8921" title=
"Source: wordly">worldly</span> effects. Hearing of what had occurred,
Hethappa sought the assistance of two Balayaru in revenging himself on
the Todas. They readily consented to help him, in return for a promise
that they should marry his daughters. The Todas were killed, and the
present inhabitants of the village Hulikallu are supposed to be the
descendants of the Balayaru and Badaga girls. The seven brothers are
now worshipped under the name Hethappa or Hetha.</p>
<p>In connection with the migration of the Badagas to the
N&#299;lgiris, the following note is given in the Gazetteer of the
N&#299;lgiris. &ldquo;When this flitting took place there is little to
show. It must have occurred after the foundation of the Ling&#257;yat
creed in the latter half of the twelfth century, as many of the Badagas
are Ling&#257;yats by faith, and sometime before the end of the
sixteenth century, since in 1602 the Catholic priests from the west
coast found them settled on the south of the plateau, and observing
much the same relations with the Todas as subsist to this day. The
present state of our knowledge does not enable us to fix more nearly
the date of the migration. That the language of the Badagas, which is a
form of Canarese, should by now have so widely altered from its
original as to be classed as a separate dialect argues that the
movement took place nearer the twelfth than the sixteenth century. On
the other hand, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69"
name="pb69">69</a>]</span>fact (pointed out by Dr. Rivers<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8928src" href="#xd21e8928" name=
"xd21e8928src">3</a>) that the Badagas are not mentioned in a single
one of the Todas&rsquo; legends about their gods, whereas the Kotas,
Kurumbas, and Irulas, each play a part in one or more of these stories,
raises the inference that the relations between the Badagas and the
Todas are recent as compared with those between the other tribes. A
critical study of the Badaga dialect might perhaps serve to fix within
closer limits the date of the migration. As now spoken, this tongue
contains letters (two forms of r for instance) and numerous words,
which are otherwise met with only in ancient books, and which strike
most strangely upon the ear of the present generation of Canarese. The
date when some of these letters and words became obsolete might
possibly be traced, and thus aid in fixing the period when the Badagas
left the low country. It is known that the two forms of r, for example,
had dropped out of use prior to the time of the grammarian
K&#275;sir&#257;ja, who lived in the thirteenth century, and that the
word betta (a hill), which the Badagas use in place of the modern
bettu, is found in the thirteenth century work
Sabdamanidarpana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the N&#299;lgiris, that
&ldquo;Nelli&#257;lam, about eight miles north-west of D&#275;v&#257;la
as the crow flies, is the residence of the Nelli&#257;lam Arasu (Urs),
who has been recognised as the janmi (landlord) of a considerable area
in the Munan&#257;d amsam, but is in reality a Canarese-speaking
Ling&#257;yat of Canarese extraction, who follows the ordinary Hindu
law of inheritance, and is not a native of the Wyn&#257;d or of
Malabar. Family tradition, though now somewhat misty, says that in the
beginning two brothers named Sad&#257;siva R&#257;ja Urs and Bhujanga
R&#257;ja Urs moved (at some date and for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>some reason not stated)
from Ummatt&#363;r (in the present Ch&#257;mar&#257;jnagar taluk of
Mysore), and settled at Malaik&#333;ta, the old fort near Kalhatti.
Their family deities were Bhujang&#275;svara and Ummatt&#363;r
Urak&#257;tti, which are still worshipped as such. They brought with
them a following of B&#275;dars and Badagas, and thereafter always
encouraged the immigration to the hills of more Canarese people. The
village of Bannimara, a mile west of Kalhatti, is still peopled by
B&#275;dars who are said to be descendants of people of that caste who
came with the two brothers; and to this day, when the Badagas of the
plateau have disputes of difficulty, they are said to go down to
Nelli&#257;lam with presents (k&#257;nikai) in their hands, and ask the
Arasu to settle their differences, while, at the time of their
periodical ceremonies (manavalai) to the memory of their ancestors,
they send a deputation to Nelli&#257;lam to invite representatives of
the Arasu to be present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Close to the village of Bethalhada is a row of cromlechs carved with
figures of the sun and moon, human beings, animals, etc., and enclosed
within a stone kraal, which the Badagas claim to be the work of their
ancestors, to whom periodical offerings are made. At the time of my
visit, there were within one of the cromlechs a conch shell, lingam,
bell, and flowers. A number of these sculptured cromlechs at
Shol&#363;r, M&#275;l&#363;r, and other spots on the N&#299;lgiris, are
described and figured by Breeks,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8937src"
href="#xd21e8937" name="xd21e8937src">4</a> who records that the
cromlech at Jakata Kamb&#275; is interesting as being the place of the
yearly sacrifice performed by the Badagas of the Jakan&#275;ri
gr&#257;ma (village) by their K&#257;ni Kurumba. And he adds that the
Badagas would seem to have usually selected the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>neighbourhood of these cromlechs for their
temples, as for example, at M&#275;l&#363;r, Kak&#363;si,
H&rsquo;laiuru, Tud&#363;r, and Jakat&#257;da.</p>

<p>It is recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8950src" href="#xd21e8950"
name="xd21e8950src">5</a>, in connection with the legends of the
Badagas, that &ldquo;in the heart of the Banagudi sh&#333;la, not far
from the Dodd&#363;ru group of cromlechs, is an odd little shrine to
Karair&#257;ya, consisting of a ruined stone hut surrounded by a low
wall, within which are a tiny cromlech, some sacred water-worn stones,
and sundry little pottery images representing a tiger, a mounted man,
and some dogs. These keep in memory, it is said, a Badaga who was slain
in combat with a tiger; and annually a festival is held, at which new
images are placed there, and vows are paid. A Kurumba makes fire by
friction and burns incense, throws sanctified water over the numerous
goats brought to be sacrificed, to see if they will shiver in the
manner always held necessary in sacrificial victims, and then slays,
one after the other, those which have shown themselves duly qualified.
Hulikal Dr&#363;g, usually known as the Dr&#363;g, is a precipitous
bluff at the very end of the range which borders on the south the great
ravine which runs up to Coonoor. It is named from the neighbouring
village of Hulikal, or tiger&rsquo;s stone, and the story goes that
this latter is so called because in it a Badaga killed a notorious
man-eater which had long been the terror of the country side. The spot
where the beast was buried is shown near the Pillaiyar temple to the
south of Hulikal village, and is marked by three stones. Burton says
there used formerly to be a stone image of the slain tiger thereabouts.
Some two miles south-east of K&#333;nakarai in a place known as
K&#333;ttai-h&#257;da, or the fort flat, lie <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>the
remains of the old fort Udaiya R&#257;ya K&#333;ta. Badaga tradition
gives a fairly detailed account of Udaiya R&#257;ya. It says he was a
chief who collected the taxes for the Ummatt&#363;r R&#257;jas, and
that he had also a fort at Kullanthorai, near Sirumugai, the remains of
which are still to be seen. He married a woman of Netlingi hamlet of
Nedugula, named Muddu Gavari, but she died by the wrath of the gods
because she persuaded him to celebrate the annual fire-walking festival
in front of the fort, instead of at the customary spot by the
Mah&#257;lingasv&#257;mi temple about half a mile off. &#256;naikatti
is a hamlet situated in the jungle of the Moyar valley. The stream
which flows past it tumbles over a pretty fall on the slopes of
B&#299;rmukk&#363; (Bimaka) hill. The Badagas call the spot
Kuduraihallo, or the ravine of the horse, and say the name was given it
because a Badaga, covered with shame at finding that his wife gave him
first sort rice but his brother who lived with them only second sort,
committed suicide by jumping his horse down the fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Mr. Grigg, the Badagas recognise eighteen different
&ldquo;castes or sects.&rdquo; These are, however, simplified by Mr. S.
M. Natesa S&#257;stri<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8962src" href=

<p>&ldquo;Udayas are Ling&#257;yats in religion, and carry the
Sivalinga&mdash;the Siva image&mdash;tied round their necks. They claim
to be superior to all the other Badagas, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>are
regarded as such. They are priests to all the Badagas of the
Ling&#257;yat class, and are strict vegetarians. They do not intermarry
with any of the other high caste Badaga sects. Udaya was, and is the
title assumed by the Mais&#363;r R&#257;jas, and those Badagas, by
being thus designated as a caste, claim superior blood in their
veins.&rdquo; The Ling&#257;yat Badagas are commonly called Lingakutti.
&ldquo;Next in rank come the H&#257;ruvas. From their name being so
closely connected with the &#256;ryas&mdash;the respectable&mdash;and
from their habit of wearing the Br&#257;hmanical thread, we are
warranted in believing that they must originally have been the poor
Br&#257;hman priests of the Badagas that migrated to this country (the
N&#299;lgiris), though they have now got themselves closely mingled
with the Badagas. These H&#257;ruvas are also strict vegetarians, and
act as priests.&rdquo; It has been suggested that the H&#257;ruvas
(jumper) derive their name from the fire-walking ceremony, which they
perform periodically. A further, and more probable suggestion has been
made to me that H&#257;ruva comes from a Canarese word meaning to beg
or pray; hence one who begs or prays, and so a Br&#257;hman. The
Canarese Basava Pur&#257;na frequently uses the word in sense.
&ldquo;The Adhik&#257;ris are to a certain extent vegetarians. The
other two high castes, and of course the low caste Toreyas also, have
no objection of any kind to eating flesh. It is also said that the
vegetarian Adhik&#257;ri, if he marries into a flesh-eating caste of
the Badagas, betakes himself to this latter very readily.&rdquo; The
Kanakas are stated by Mr. Grigg to be the accountants, who were
probably introduced when the hills were under the sway of the Tamil
chiefs. This would, however, seem to be very improbable. &ldquo;The
Toreyas are regarded as sons and servants to the five high caste Badaga
sects&mdash;to the H&#257;ruvas especially. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>They are
the lowest in the scale, and they are prohibited from intermarrying
with the other or high caste Badagas, as long as they are sons to
them.&rdquo; The Toreya does the menial duties for the tribe. He is the
village servant, carries the corpses to the burning-ground, conveys the
news of a death from village to village, is the first to get shaved
when a death occurs, and is sent along with a woman when she is going
to visit her mother or mother-in-law at a distance from her own home.
&ldquo;The Udayas, Adhik&#257;ris and Kanakas are Ling&#257;yats in
religion, and the other three, the H&#257;ruvas, Badagas, and Toreyas
are Saivites.&rdquo; Of the six divisions referred to, the Udayas and
Toreyas are endogamous, but intermarriage is permissible between the
other four. At the census, 1891, a large number of Badagas returned as
their sub-division Vakkaliga, which means cultivator, and is the name
of the great cultivating caste of Mysore.</p>
<p>Seven miles west of Coonoor is a village named Athik&#257;rihatti,
or village of the Athik&#257;ri or Adhik&#257;ri section of the
Badagas. &ldquo;The story goes that these people, under a leader named
Karibetta R&#257;ya, came from Sarig&#363;r in Mysore territory, and
settled first at Nelliturai (a short distance south-west of
M&#275;ttup&#257;laiyam) and afterwards at T&#363;d&#363;r (on the
plateau west of Kulakambi) and Tadasimarahatti (to the north-west of
M&#275;l&#363;r), and that it was they who erected the sculptured
cromlechs of T&#363;d&#363;r and M&#275;l&#363;r. T&#363;d&#363;r and
Tadasimarahatti are now both deserted; but in the former a cattle
kraal, an old shrine, and a pit for fire-walking may still be seen, and
in the latter another kraal, and one of the raised stone platforms
called mandaikallu by the Badagas. Tradition says that the Badagas left
these places and founded Athik&#257;rihatti and its hamlets instead,
because the Kurumbas round about continually troubled <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>them
with their magic arts, and indeed killed by sorcery several of their
most prominent citizens.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9013src"
href="#xd21e9013" name="xd21e9013src">7</a></p>

"images/pl1-075.jpg" alt="Badaga Girls." width="514" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Badaga Girls.</p>
</div>
<p>Like other Canarese people, the Badagas have exogamous septs or
k&#363;las, of which M&#257;ri, Madhave (marriage), Kast&#363;ri
(musk), and Belli (silver) are examples. A very large number of
families belong to the M&#257;ri and Madhave septs, which were time
after time given as the sept name in reply to my enquiries. It may be
noted that Belli occurs as an exogamous sept of the Canarese classes
Vakkaliga, Toreya, and Kuruba, and Kast&#363;ri is recorded in my notes
as a sept of the Vakkaligas and Telugu Kammas.</p>
<p>The Badagas dwell in extensive villages, generally situated on the
summit of a low hillock, composed of rows of comfortable thatched or
tiled houses, and surrounded by the fields, which yield the crops. The
houses are not separate tenements, but a line of dwellings under one
continuous roof, and divided by party walls. Sometimes there are two or
three, or more lines, forming streets. Each house is partitioned off
into an outer (edumane) and inner apartment (ozhaga or &#333;gamane).
If the family has cows or buffaloes yielding milk, a portion of the
latter is converted into a milk-house (h&#257;g&#333;ttu), in which the
milk is stored, and which no woman may enter. Even males who are under
pollution, from having touched or passed near a Kota or Paraiyan, or
other cause, may not enter it until they have had a ceremonial bath. To
some houses a loft, made of bamboo posts, is added, to serve as a
store-house. In every Badaga village there is a raised platform
composed of a single boulder or several stones with an erect stone slab
set up thereon, called s&#363;ththu <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76"
href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>kallu. There is, further, a
platform, made of bricks and mud, called mandhe kallu, whereon the
Badagas, when not working, sit at ease. In their folk-tales men seated
thereon are made to give information concerning the approach of
strangers to the village. Strangers, who are not Badagas, are called
Holeya. The Rev. G. Richter gives<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9027src"
href="#xd21e9027" name="xd21e9027src">8</a> Badaga Holeya as a division
of the lowly Holeyas, who came to Coorg from the Mysore country. In
front of the houses, the operations of drying and threshing grain are
carried out. The cattle are kept in stone kraals, or covered sheds
close to the habitations, and the litter is kept till it is knee or
waist deep, and then carried away as manure for the Badaga&rsquo;s
land, or planters&rsquo; estates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; it has been said,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9032src" href="#xd21e9032" name="xd21e9032src">9</a> &ldquo;can
beat the Badaga at making mother earth produce to her utmost capacity,
unless it be a Chinese gardener. To-day we see a portion of the hill
side covered with rocks and boulders. The Badagas become possessed of
this scene of chaos, and turn out into the place in hundreds, reducing
it, in a few weeks, to neat order. The unwieldy boulders, having been
rolled aside, serve their purpose by being turned into a wall to keep
out cattle, etc. The soil is pounded and worried until it becomes
amenable to reason, and next we see a green crop running in waves over
the surface. The Badagas are the most progressive of all the hill
tribes, and always willing to test any new method of cultivation, or
new crops brought to their notice by the Nilgiri Horticultural
Society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing in 1832, Harkness states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9037src"
href="#xd21e9037" name="xd21e9037src">10</a> that &ldquo;on leaving his
house in the morning the Burgher pays his adoration <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>to the
god of day, proceeds to the tu-el or yard, in which the cattle have
been confined, and, again addressing the sun as the emblem of Siva,
asks his blessing, and liberates the herd. He allows the cattle to
stray about in the neighbourhood of the village, on a piece of ground
which is always kept for this purpose, and, having performed his
morning ablutions, commences the milking. This is also preceded by
further salutations and praises to the sun. On entering the house in
the evening, the Burgher addresses the lamp, now the only light, or
visible emblem of the deity. &lsquo;Thou, creator of this and of all
worlds, the greatest of the great, who art with us, as well in the
mountain as in the wilderness, who keepeth the wreaths that adorn the
head from fading, who guardeth the foot from the thorn, God, among a
hundred, may we be prosperous.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Badaga understands the rotation of crops well. On his land he
cultivates bearded wheat (beer ganji), barley, onions, garlic,
potatoes, k&#299;r&#275; (<i lang="la-x-bio">Amarantus</i>), s&#257;mai
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Panicum miliare</i>), tenai (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Setaria italica</i>), etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the Badagas,&rdquo; Mr. Natesa Sastri writes,
&ldquo;the position of the women is somewhat different from what it is
among most peoples. Every Badaga has a few acres to cultivate, but he
does not mainly occupy himself with them, for his wife does all the
out-door farm work, while he is engaged otherwise in earning something
in hard cash. To a Badaga, therefore, his wife is his capital. Her
labour in the field is considered to be worth one rupee per day, while
an average male Badaga earns merely three annas. A Badaga woman, who
has not her own acres to cultivate, finds work on some other lands. She
thus works hard for her husband and family, and is quite content with
the coarsest food&mdash;the korali (<i lang="la-x-bio">Setaria
italica</i>) flour&mdash;leaving the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>better food to the male
members of the family. This fact, and the hard work the Badaga women
have to perform, may perhaps account to some extent for the slight
build of the Badagas as a race. The male Badaga, too, works in the
field, or at his own craft if he is not a cultivator, but his love for
ready cash is always so great that, even if he had a harvest to gather
the next morning, he would run away as a cooly for two annas
wages.&rdquo; Further, Mr. Grigg states that &ldquo;as the men
constantly leave their villages to work on coffee plantations, much of
the labour in their own fields, as well as ordinary household work, is
performed by the women. They are so industrious, and their services of
such value to their husbands, that a Badaga sometimes pays 150 or 200
rupees as dowry for his wife.&rdquo; In the off season for cultivation,
I am informed, the Badaga woman collects faggots for home consumption,
and stores them near her house, and the women prepare the fields for
cultivation by weeding, breaking the earth, and collecting manure.</p>
<p>In his report on the revenue settlement of the Nilgiris (1885), Mr.
(now Sir) R. S. Benson notes that &ldquo;concurrently with the
so-called abolition of the bhurty (or shifting) system of cultivation,
Mr. Grant abolished the peculiar system in vogue up to that time in
Kundahnad, which had been transferred from Malabar to the Nilgiris in
1860. This system was known as erk&#257;du kothuk&#257;du. Under it, a
tax of Re. 1 to Re. 1&ndash;8&ndash;0 was levied for the right to use a
plough or er, and a tax of from 4 to 8 annas was levied for the right
to use a hoe or kothu. The so-called patta issued to the ryot under
this system was really no more than a license to use one or more hoes,
as the case might be. It merely specified the amount payable for each
instrument, but in no cases <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href=
"#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>was the extent or position of the
lands to be cultivated specified. The ryot used his implements whenever
and wherever he pleased. No restrictions, even on the felling of
forests, were imposed, so that the hill-sides and valleys were cleared
at will. The system was abolished in 1862. But, during the settlement,
I found this erk&#257;du kothuk&#257;du system still in force in the
flourishing Badaga village of Kinnakorai, with some fifty
houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with the local self-government of the Badagas, Mr. A.
Rajah Bahadur Mudaliar writes to me as follows. &ldquo;In former days,
the monegar was a great personage, as he formed the unit of the
administration. The appointment was more or less hereditary, and it
generally fell to the lot of the richest and most well-to-do. All
disputes within his jurisdiction were placed before him, and his
decision was accepted as final. In simple matters, such as partition of
property, disputes between husband and wife, etc., the monegars
themselves disposed of them. But, when questions of a complicated
nature presented themselves, they took as their colleagues other people
of the villages, and the disputes were settled by the collective wisdom
of the village elders. They assembled at a place set apart for the
purpose beneath a n&#299;m (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>)
or p&#299;pal tree (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus religiosa</i>) on a raised
platform (ratchai), generally situated at the entrance to the village.
The monegar was <i>ex-officio</i> president of such councils. He and
the committee had power to fine the parties, to excommunicate them, and
to readmit them to the caste. Parents resorted to the monegar for
counsel in the disposal of their daughters in marriage, and in finding
brides for their sons. If any one had the audacity to run counter to
the wishes of the monegar in matters <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>matrimonial, he had the
power to throw obstacles in the way of such marriages taking place. The
monegar, in virtue of his position, wielded much power, and ruled the
village as he pleased.&rdquo; In the old days, it is said, when he
visited any village within his jurisdiction, the monegar had the
privilege of having the best women or maids of the place to share his
cot according to his choice. In former times, the monegar used to wear
a silver ring as the badge of office, and some Badagas still have in
their possession such rings, which are preserved as heirlooms, and
worshipped during festivals. The term monegar is, at the present day,
used for the village revenue official and munsiff.</p>
<p>I gather that each exogamous sept has its headman, called Gouda, who
is assisted by a Parpattik&#257;ran, and decides tribal matters, such
as disputes, divorce, etc. Fines, when inflicted, go towards feasting
the tribe, and doing p&#363;ja (worship) to the gods. In the case of a
dispute between two parties, one challenges the other to take an oath
in a temple before the village council. A declaration on oath settles
the matter at issue, and the parties agree to abide by it. It is the
duty of the Parpattik&#257;ran to make arrangements for such events as
the Heththesw&#257;mi, Devv&#275; and Bairaganni festivals, and the
buffalo sacrificing festival at Konakkore. The Parpattik&#257;ran takes
part in the purification of excommunicated members of the tribe, when
they are received back into it, for example, on release from prison.
The tongue of the delinquent is burnt with a hot sandal stick, and a
new waist thread put on. He is taken to the temple, where he stands
amidst the assembled Badagas, who touch his head with a cane. He then
prostrates himself at the feet of the Parpattik&#257;ran, who smears
his forehead with sacred ashes. It is, further, the duty of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>the Parpattik&#257;ran to be present on the
occasion of the Kannikattu (pregnancy) ceremony.</p>
<p>A quarter of a century ago, a Badaga could be at once picked out
from the other tribes of the N&#299;lgiris by his wearing a turban.
But, in the present advanced age, not only does the Toda sometimes
appear in the national head-dress, but even Irulas and Kurumbas, who
only a short time ago were buried in the jungles, living like pigs and
bears on roots, honey and other forest produce, turn up on Sundays in
the Kotagiri bazar, clad in turban and coat of English cut. And, as the
less civilised tribes don the turban, so the college student abandons
this picturesque form of head-gear in favour of the less becoming and
less washable porkpie cap, while the Badaga men and youths glory in a
knitted night-cap of flaring red or orange hue. The body of the Badaga
man is covered by a long body-cloth, sometimes with red and blue
stripes, wrapped &ldquo;so loosely that, as a man works in the fields,
he is obliged to stop between every few strokes of his hoe, to gather
up his cloth, and throw one end over his shoulder.&rdquo; Male
adornment is limited to gold ear-rings of a special pattern made by
Kotas or goldsmiths, a silver waist-thread, silver bangle on the wrist,
and silver, copper, or brass rings. The women wear a white body-cloth,
a white under-cloth tied round the chest, tightly wrapped square across
the breasts, and reaching to the knees, and a white cloth worn like a
cap on the head. As types of female jewelry and tattooing, the
following examples may be cited:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Tattooed on forehead with dashes, circles and crescent; spot on
chin; double row of dots on each upper arm over deltoid; and devices
and double row of dots on right forearm. Gold ornament in left nostril.
Necklets of glass beads and silver links with four-anna <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>piece
pendent. Silver armlet above right elbow. Four copper armlets above
left elbow. Four silver and seven composition bangles on left forearm.
Two silver rings on right ring-finger; two steel rings on left
ring-finger.</p>
<p>2. Tattooed on forehead; quadruple row of dots over right deltoid;
star on right forearm.</p>
<p>3. Tattooed like the preceding on forehead and upper arm. Spot on
chin; elaborate device on right forearm; rayed star or sun on back of
hand.</p>
<p>4. Tattooed like the preceding on forehead and arm. Triple row of
dots on back and front of left wrist, and double row of dots, with
circle surrounded by dots, across chest.</p>
<p>Toreya women are only allowed to wear bangles on the wrist.</p>
<p>The tattoo marks on the foreheads of Udayar women consist of a
crescent and dot, and they have a straight line tattooed at the outer
corners of the eyes. Women of the other sub-divisions have on the
forehead two circles with two vertical dashes between them, and a
horizontal or crescentic dash below. The circles are made by pricking
in the pigment over an impression made with a finger ring, or over a
black mark made by means of such a ring. The operation is performed
either by a Badaga or Korava woman. The former uses as needles the
spines of <i lang="la-x-bio">Carissa spinarum</i>, and a mixture of
finely powdered charcoal or lamp-black mixed with rice gruel. The marks
on the forehead are made when a girl is about eight or nine years old,
and do not, as stated by Mr. Natesa Sastri, proclaim to the whole
Badaga world that a girl is of marriageable age.</p>
<p>In colour the Badagas are lighter than the other hill tribes, and
the comparative pallor of the skin is specially noticeable in the
females, whom, with very few exceptions, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>I was only able to study
by surreptitious examination, when we met on the roads. In physique,
the typical Badaga man is below middle height, smooth-skinned, of
slender build, with narrow chest and shoulders.</p>
<p>Badaga men have cicatrices on the shoulder and forearm as the result
of branding with a fire-stick when they are lads, with the object, it
is said, of giving strength, and preventing pain when milking or
churning. In like manner, the Todas have raised cicatrices (keloids) on
the shoulder produced by branding with a fire-stick. They believe that
the branding enables them to milk the buffaloes with perfect ease.</p>
<p>The Badagas have a very extensive repertoire of hora hesaru, or
nicknames, of which the following are examples:&mdash;</p>

<p>Among the Badagas, Konga is used as a term of abuse. Those who made
mistakes in matching Holmgren&rsquo;s wools, with which I tested them,
were, always called Konga by the onlookers.</p>
<p>When two Badagas meet each other, the elder touches the head of the
younger with his right hand. This form of salutation is known as giving
the head. A person of the Badaga section gives the head, as it is
called, to an Udaiyar, in token of the superiority of the latter. When
people belong to the same sept, they say &ldquo;Ba, anna, appa, thamma,
amma, akka&rdquo; (come, father, brother, mother, sister, etc.). But,
if they are of different septs, they will say &ldquo;Ba, m&#257;ma,
m&#257;mi, bava&rdquo; (come, uncle, aunt, brother-in-law, etc.).
&ldquo;Whenever,&rdquo; Dr. Rivers writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9198src" href="#xd21e9198" name="xd21e9198src">11</a> &ldquo;a
Toda meets a Badaga monegar (headman), or an old Badaga with whom he is
acquainted, a salutation passes between the two. The Toda stands before
the Badaga, inclines his head slightly, and says &lsquo;Madtin
pudia.&rsquo; (Madtin, you have come). The Badaga replies
&lsquo;Buthuk! buthuk!&rsquo; (blessing, blessing), and rests his hand
on the top of the Toda&rsquo;s head. This greeting only takes place
between Todas and the more important of the Badaga community. It would
seem that every Badaga headman may be greeted in this way, but a Toda
will only greet other Badaga elders, if he is already acquainted with
them. The salutation is made to members of all the various castes of
the Badagas, except the Toreyas. It has been held to imply that the
Todas regard the Badagas as their superiors, but it is doubtful how far
this is the case. The Todas themselves say they follow the custom
because the Badagas help to support them. It seems to be a mark of
respect paid <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>by the Todas to the elders of a tribe with which
they have very close relations, and it is perhaps significant that no
similar sign of respect is shown to Toda elders by the
Badagas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every Badaga family has its Muttu Kota, from whom it gets the
agricultural implements, pots, hoes, etc. In return, the Kotas receive
an annual present of food-grains, mustard and potatoes. For a Kota
funeral, the Badagas have to give five rupees or a quantity of rice,
and a buffalo. The pots obtained from the Kotas are not used
immediately, but kept for three days in the jungle, or in a bush in
some open spot. They are then taken to the outer apartment of the
house, and kept there for three days, when they are smeared with the
bark of <i lang="la-x-bio">Meliosma pungens</i> (the t&#363;d tree of
the Todas) and culms of <i lang="la-x-bio">Andropogon
Sch&oelig;nanthus</i> (bzambe hullu). Thus purified, the pots are used
for boiling water in for three days, and may then be used for any
purpose. The Badagas are said to give a present of grain annually to
the Todas. Every Toda mand (or mad) seems to have its own group of
Badaga families, who pay them this gudu, as it is called. &ldquo;There
are,&rdquo; Dr. Rivers writes, &ldquo;several regulations concerning
the food of the palol (dairy man of a Toda sacred dairy). Any grain he
eats must be that provided by the Badagas. At the present time more
rice is eaten than was formerly the case. This is not grown by the
Badagas, but nevertheless the rice for the palol must be obtained
through them. The palol wears garments of a dark grey material made in
the Coimbatore district. They are brought to the palol by the Badaga
called tikelfmav. The earthenware vessels of the inner room (of the ti
dairy) are not obtained from the Kotas, like the ordinary vessels, but
are made by Hindus, and are procured through the Badagas.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Badagas live in dread of the Kurumbas, and the Kurumba
constantly comes under reference in their folk-stories. The Kurumba is
the necromancer of the hills, and believed to be possessed of the power
of outraging women, removing their livers, and so causing their death,
while the wound heals by magic, so that no trace of the operation is
left. He is supposed, too, to have the power of opening the bolts of
doors by magic and effecting an entrance into a house at night for some
nefarious purpose. The Toda or Badaga requires the services of the
Kurumba, when he fancies that any member of his family is possessed of
the devil, or when he wants to remove the evil eye, to which he
imagines that his children have been subjected. The Kurumba does his
best to remove the malady by repeating various mantrams (magical
formul&aelig;). If he fails, and if any suspicion is aroused in the
mind of the Toda or Badaga that he is allowing the devil to play his
pranks instead of loosing his hold on the supposed victim, woe betide
him. The wrath of the entire village, or even the whole tribe, is
raised against the unhappy Kurumba. His hut is surrounded at night, and
the entire household massacred in cold blood, and their huts set on
fire. This is very cleverly carried out, and the isolated position of
the Kurumba settlements allows of very little clue for identification.
In 1835 no less than fifty-eight Kurumbas were thus murdered, and a
smaller number in 1875 and 1882. In 1891 the live inmates of a single
hut were murdered, and their hut burnt to ashes, because, it was said,
one of them who had been treating a sick Badaga child failed to cure
it. The crime was traced to some Kotas in conjunction with Badagas, but
the District Judge disbelieved the evidence, and all who were charged
were acquitted. Every Badaga family pays an annual <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>tax of
four annas to the Kurumbas, and, if a Kurumba comes to a Badaga hatti
(village), a subscription is raised as an inducement to him to take his
departure. The Kurumba receives a fee for every Badaga funeral, and for
the pregnancy ceremony (kannikattu).</p>
<p>It is noted by Dr. Rivers that &ldquo;the Toda sorcerers are not
only feared by their fellow Todas, but also by the Badagas, and it is
probably largely owing to fear of Toda sorcery that the Badagas
continue to pay their tribute of grain. The Badagas may also consult
the Toda diviners, and it is probable that the belief of the Badagas in
the magical powers of the Todas is turned to good account by the
latter. In some cases, Todas, have been killed by Badagas owing to this
belief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the Todas, the duties of milking the buffaloes and dairy-work
are entrusted to special individuals, whereas any Badaga male may,
after initiation, milk the cows and buffaloes, provided that he is free
from pollution. Every Badaga boy, when he is about seven or nine years
old, is made to milk a cow on an auspicious day, or on new year&rsquo;s
day. The ceremony is thus described by Mr. Natesa Sastri. &ldquo;Early
in the morning of the day appointed for this ceremony, the boy is
bathed, and appears in his holiday dress. A she-buffalo, with her calf,
stands before his house, waiting to be milked. The parents, or other
elder relations of the boy, and those who have been invited to be
present on the occasion, or whose duty it is to be present, then
conduct the boy to the spot. The father, or some one of the agnatic
kindred, gives into the hands of the boy a bamboo vessel called
hon&#275;, which is already very nearly full of fresh-drawn milk. The
boy receives the vessel with both his hands, and is conducted to the
buffalo. The elder relations show him the process, and the boy,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>sitting down, milks a small quantity into the
hon&#275;. This is his first initiation into the duty of milking, and
it is that he may not commit mistakes on the very first day of his
milking that the hon&#275; is previously filled almost to the brim. The
boy takes the vessel filled with milk into his house, and pours some of
the sacred fluid into all his household eating vessels&mdash;a sign
that from that day he has taken up on himself the responsibility of
supplying the family with milk. He also throws some milk in the faces
of his parents and relatives. They receive it very kindly, and bless
him, and request him to continue thus to milk the buffaloes, and bring
plenty and prosperity to the house. After this, the boy enters the
milk-house (h&#257;g&#333;ttu), and places milk in his hon&#275; there.
From this moment, and all through his life, he may enter into that
room, and this is therefore considered a very important
ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cow or buffalo, which has calved for the first time, has to be
treated in a special manner. For three or five days it is not milked. A
boy is then selected to milk it. He must not sleep on a mat, or wear a
turban, and, instead of tying his cloth round his waist, must wear it
loosely over his body. Meat is forbidden, and he must avoid, and not
speak to polluting classes, such as Irulas and Kotas, and menstruating
women. On the day appointed for milking the animal, the boy bathes, and
proceeds to milk it into a new hon&#275; purified by smearing a paste
of <i lang="la-x-bio">Meliosma</i> (t&#363;d) leaves and bark over it,
and heating it over a fire. The milk is taken to a stream, where three
cups are made of <i lang="la-x-bio">Argyreia</i> (m&#299;nige) leaves,
into which a small quantity of the milk is placed. The cups are then
put in the water. The remainder of the milk in the hon&#275; is also
poured into the stream. In some places, especially where a
M&#257;deswara temple is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href=
"#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>close at hand, the milk is taken to
the temple, and given to the p&#363;j&#257;ri. With a portion of the
milk some plantain fruits are made into a pulp, and given to an Udaya,
who throws them into a stream. The boy is treated with some respect by
his family during the period when he milks the animal, and is given
food first. This he must eat off a plate made of <i>Argyreia</i>, or
plantain leaves.</p>
<p>Besides the h&#257;g&#333;ttu within the house, the Badagas have, at
certain places, separate dairy-houses near a temple dedicated to
Heththesw&#257;mi, of which the one at Bairaganni (or B&#275;rganni)
appears to be the most important. The dairy p&#363;j&#257;ri is here,
like the Toda palol, a celibate. In 1905, he was a young lad, whom my
Br&#257;hman assistant set forth to photograph. He was, however, met at
a distance from the village by a headman, who assured him that he could
not take the photograph without the sanction of fifteen villages. The
p&#363;j&#257;ri is not allowed to wander freely about the village, or
talk to grown-up women. He cooks his own food within the temple
grounds, and wears his cloth thrown loosely over his body. Once a year,
on the occasion of a festival, he is presented with new cloths and
turban, which alone he may wear. He must be a strict vegetarian. A
desire to marry and abandon the priesthood is believed to be conveyed
in dreams, or through one inspired. Before leaving the temple service,
he must train his successor in the duties, and retires with the gains
acquired by the sale of the products of the herd and temple offerings.
The village of Bairaganni is regarded as sacred, and possesses no
holagudi (menstrual hut).</p>
<p>Bishop Whitehead adds that &ldquo;buffaloes are given as offerings
to the temple at Bairaganni, and become the property of the
p&#363;j&#257;ri, who milks them, and uses the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>milk for
his food. All the villagers give him rice every day. He may only eat
once a day, at about 3 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> He cooks the meal
himself, and empties the rice from the cooking-pot by turning it over
once. If the rice does not come out the first time, he cannot take it
at all. When he wants to get married, another boy is appointed in his
place. The buffaloes are handed over to his successor.&rdquo; The
following legend in connection with Bairaganni is also recorded by
Bishop Whitehead. &ldquo;There is a village in the M&#275;kan&#257;d
division of the N&#299;lgiris called Nund&#257;la. A man had a
daughter. He wanted to marry her to a man in the Parangan&#257;d
division about a hundred years ago. She did not wish to marry him. The
father insisted, but she refused again and again. At last she wished to
die, and came near a tank, on the bank of which was a tree. She sat
under the tree and washed, and then threw herself into the tank. One of
the men of Bairaganni in the Parangan&#257;d division saw the woman in
a dream. She told him that she was not a human being but a goddess, an
incarnation of Parvati. The people of Nund&#257;la built a strong bund
(embankment) round the tank, and allow no woman to go on it. Only the
p&#363;j&#257;ri, and Badagas who have prepared themselves by fasting
and ablution, are allowed to go on the bund to offer p&#363;ja, which
is done by breaking cocoanuts, and offering rice, flowers, and fruits.
The woman told the man in his dream to build a temple at Bairaganni,
which is now the chief temple of Heththesw&#257;mi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the initiation of a Ling&#257;yat Badaga into his
religion, which takes place at about his thirteenth birthday, Mr.
Natesa Sastri writes as follows. &ldquo;The priest conducts this
ceremony, and the elder relations of the family have only to arrange
for the performance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91"
name="pb91">91</a>]</span>of it. The priests belong to the Udaya sect.
They live in their own villages, and are specially sent for, and come
to the boy&rsquo;s village for the occasion. The ceremony is generally
done to several boys of about the same age on the same day. On the day
appointed, all the people in the Badaga village, where this ceremony is
to take place, observe a strict fast. The cows and buffaloes are all
milked very early in the morning, and not a drop of the milk thus
collected is given out, or taken by even the tenderest children of the
village, who may require it very badly. The Udaya priest arrives near
the village between 10 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> and noon on the day
appointed. He never goes into the village, but stops near some rivulet
adjacent to it. The relations of the boy approach him with a new
basket, containing five measures of uncooked rice, pulse, gh&#299;,
etc., and a quarter of a rupee&mdash;one fanam, as it is generally
designated. The priest sits near the water-course, and lights a fire on
the bank. Perfumes are thrown profusely into it, and this is almost the
only ceremony before the fire. The boys, whose turn it is to receive
the linga that day, are all directed to bathe in the river. A plantain
leaf, cut into one foot square, is placed in front of the fire towards
the east of it. The lingas, kept in readiness by the parents of the
boys, are now received by the priest, and placed on the leaves. The
boys are asked to wash them&mdash;each one the linga meant for his
wearing&mdash;in water and milk. Then comes the time for the
expenditure of all the collected milk of the morning. Profusely the
white fluid is poured, till the whole rivulet is nothing but a stream
of milk. After the lingas are thus washed, the boys give them to the
priest, who places them in his left palm, and, covering them with his
right, utters, with all the solemnity due to the occasion, the
following <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>incantation, while the boys and the whole village
assembled there listen to it with the most profound respect and
veneration &lsquo;Oh! Siva, Hara, Basava, the Lord of all the six
thousand and three thousand names and glories, the Lord of one lakh and
ninety-six thousand ganas (body-guards of Siva), the donor of water,
the daily-to-be worshipped, the husband of Parvati. Oh! Lord, O! Siva
Linga, thy feet alone are our resort. Oh! Siva, Siva, Siva,
Siva.&rsquo; While pronouncing this prayer, the priest now and then
removes his right palm, and pours water and milk round the sacred fire,
and over the lingas resting in his left palm. He then places each of
the lingas in a cloth of one cubit square, rolls it up, and requests
the boys to hold out their right palms. The young Badaga receives it,
repeats the prayer given about five times, and, during each repetition,
the palm holding the linga tied up in the cloth is carried nearer and
nearer to his neck. When that is reached (on the fifth utterance of the
incantation), the priest ties the ends of the rolled up cloth
containing the Siva emblem loosely round the boy&rsquo;s neck, while
the latter is all the while kneeling down, holding with both his hands
the feet of the priest. After the linga has been tied, the priest
blesses him thus: &lsquo;May one become one thousand to you. May you
ever preserve in you the Siva Linga. If you do so, you will have plenty
of milk and food, and you will prosper for one thousand years in name
and fame, kine and coin.&rsquo; If more than one have to receive the
linga on the same day, each of them has to undergo this ceremony. After
the ceremony is over, the priest returns to his village with the rice,
etc., and fees. Every house, in which a boy has received the linga, has
to give a grand feast on that day. Even the poorest Badaga must feed at
least five other Badagas.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93"
href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>The foregoing account of the investiture with the lingam apparently
applies to the M&#275;kan&#257;d Udayas. The following note is based on
information supplied by the Udayas of Parangin&#257;d. The ceremony of
investiture is performed either on new year&rsquo;s day or
Sivar&#257;thri by an Udaya priest in the house of a respected member
of the community (doddamane), which is vacated for the occasion. The
houses of the boys and girls who are to receive lingams are cleaned,
and festoons of t&#363;d and mango leaves, lime fruits, and flowers of
<i lang="la-x-bio">Leucas aspera</i> (thumb&#275;) are tied across the
doorways, and in front of the house where the ceremony is to be
performed. Until the conclusion thereof, all the people of the village
fast. The candidates, with their parents, and the officiating priest
repair to the doddamane. The lingams are handed over to the priest,
who, taking them up one by one, does p&#363;ja to them, and gives them
to the children. They in turn do p&#363;ja, and the lingams, wrapped in
pink silk or cotton cloths, are tied round their necks. The p&#363;ja
consists of washing the lingams in cow&rsquo;s urine and milk, smearing
them with sandal and turmeric paste, throwing flowers on them, and
waving incense and burning camphor before them. After the investiture,
the novices are taught a prayer, which is not a stereotyped formula,
but varies with the priest and village.</p>
<p>Like other Lingayats, the Udayas respect the Jangam, but do not
employ the Jangama thirtham (water used for washing the Jangam&rsquo;s
feet) for bathing their lingams. In Udaya villages there is no special
menstrual hut (holagudi). Milk is not regarded by them as a sacred
product, so there is no h&#257;g&#333;ttu in their houses. Nor do they
observe the Manavalai festival in honour of ancestors. Other ceremonies
are celebrated by them, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href=
"#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>by other Badagas, but they do not
employ the services of a Kurumba.</p>
<p>Important agricultural ceremonies are performed by the Badagas at
the time of sowing and harvest. The seed-sowing ceremony takes place in
March, and, in some places, <i>e.g.</i>, the M&#275;kan&#257;d and
Parangin&#257;d, a Kurumba plays an important part in it. On an
auspicious day&mdash;a Tuesday before the crescent moon&mdash;a
p&#363;j&#257;ri of the Devv&#275; temple sets out several hours before
dawn with five or seven kinds of grain in a basket and sickle,
accompanied by a Kurumba, and leading a pair of bullocks with a plough.
On reaching the field selected, the p&#363;j&#257;ri pours the grain
into the cloth of the Kurumba, and, yoking the animals to the plough,
makes three furrows in the soil. The Kurumba, stopping the bullocks,
kneels on the ground between the furrows facing east. Removing his
turban, he places it on the ground, and, closing his ears with his
palms, bawls out &ldquo;Dho, Dho,&rdquo; thrice. He then rises, and
scatters the grain thrice on the soil. The p&#363;j&#257;ri and Kurumba
then return to the village, and the former deposits what remains of the
grain in the store-room (attu). A new pot, full of water, is placed in
the milk-house, and the p&#363;j&#257;ri dips his right hand therein,
saying &ldquo;Nerathubitta&rdquo; (it is full). This ceremony is an
important one for the Badagas, as, until it has been performed, sowing
may not commence. It is a day of feasting, and, in addition to rice,
<i>Dolichos Lablab</i> is cooked.</p>

</div>
<p>The other agricultural ceremony is called Devv&#275; habba or tenai
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Setaria italica</i>), and is usually celebrated in
June or July, always on a Monday. It is apparently performed in honour
of the two gods Mah&#257;lingasw&#257;mi and Hiriya Udaya, to whom a
group of villages will have temples dedicated. For example, the Badagas
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>the neighbourhood of Kotagiri have their Hiriya
Udaya temple at T&#257;ndan&#257;d, and Mah&#257;lingasw&#257;mi temple
at Kann&#275;rmukku. This Devv&#275; festival, which should on no
account be pronounced duvve, which means burning-ground, is celebrated
at one place, whither the Badagas from other villages proceed, to take
part in it. About midday, some Badagas and the temple p&#363;j&#257;ri
go from the temple of Hiriya Udaya to that of Mah&#257;lingasw&#257;mi.
The procession is usually headed by a Kurumba, who scatters fragments
of t&#363;d bark and wood as he goes on his way. The p&#363;j&#257;ri
takes with him the materials necessary for doing p&#363;ja, and, after
worshipping Mah&#257;lingasw&#257;mi, the party return to the Hiriya
Udaya temple, where milk and cooked rice are offered to the various
gods within the temple precincts. On the following day, all assemble at
the temple, and a Kurumba brings a few sheaves of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Setaria italica</i>, and ties them to a stone set up at the
main entrance. After this, p&#363;ja is done, and the people offer
cocoanuts to the god. Later on, all the women of the Madhave sept, who
have given birth to a first-born child, come, dressed up in holiday
attire, with their babies, to the temple. On this day they wear a
special nose ornament, called elemukkuththi, which is only worn on one
other occasion, at the funeral of a husband. The women do p&#363;ja to
Hiriya Udaya, and the p&#363;j&#257;ri gives them a small quantity of
rice on m&#299;nige (<i lang="la-x-bio">Argyreia</i>) leaves. After
eating this, they leave the temple in a line, and wash their hands with
water given to them by the p&#363;j&#257;ri. This ceremonial, performed
by women of the Madhave sept, is called Mand&#275;dhanda. As soon as
the Devv&#275; festival is concluded, the reaping of the crop
commences, and a measure or two of grain from the crop gathered on the
first day, called n&#299;sal, is set apart for the
Mah&#257;lingasw&#257;mi temple. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96"
href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>The most important gods of the Badagas are Heththesw&#257;mi,
Mah&#257;lingasw&#257;mi, Hiriya Udaya, M&#257;deswara,
M&#257;nk&#257;li, Jadesw&#257;mi, and N&#299;lgiri Rangasw&#257;mi.
And at the present day, some Badagas proceed to the plains, to worship
at the Saivite temple at Karamadai in Coimbatore, or at Nanjang&#333;d
in Mysore.</p>
<p>The festival in honour of Heththesw&#257;mi is celebrated in the
month of January at Baireganni. It is sometimes called ermathohabba,
as, with it, ploughing operations cease. It always commences on a
Monday, and usually lasts eight days. A S&#275;dan or D&#275;v&#257;nga
weaver comes with his portable hand-loom, and sufficient thread for
weaving a dhubati (coarse cloth) and turban. At Baireganni there is a
special house, in which these articles are woven. But, at other places
where the festival is observed, the Badagas go to the weaver&rsquo;s
village to fetch the required cloths. Early on the second morning of
the festival, some of the more respected Badagas and the weaver proceed
to the weaving house after bathing. The weaver sets up his loom, and
worships it by offering incense, and other things. The Badagas give him
a new cloth, and a small sum of money, and ask him to weave a dhubati
and two kachches (narrow strips of cloth). Daily, throughout the
festival, the Badagas collect near the temple, and indulge in music and
songs. Until the last day, they are not permitted to set eyes on the
god Heththesw&#257;mi. On the morning of the last day, the
p&#363;j&#257;ri, accompanied by all the Badagas, takes the newly woven
cloths to a stream, in which they are washed. When they are dry, all
proceed to the temple, where the idol is dressed up in them, and all,
on this occasion only, are allowed to look at it. Devotees pay a small
offering of money, which is placed on a tray near the idol. The crowd
begins to disperse in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97"
name="pb97">97</a>]</span>the afternoon, and, on their way back to
their villages, the wants of the travellers are attended to by people
posted at intervals with coffee, fruit, and other articles of food. If
the Badagas have to go to a weaver&rsquo;s village for the cloths, the
weaver is, when the order is given for them, presented with four annas,
after he has bathed. When handing the money to him, the Badagas bawl
out &ldquo;This is the fee for making the cloths to be worn by Heththe
Iram&#257;sthi and Parasakti Parvati.&rdquo; On the last day of the
festival, the cloths are washed, and one of them is made to represent
an idol, which is decorated with waist and neck ornaments, and an
umbrella. All prostrate themselves before it, and make offerings of
money. Fruits and other things are then offered to Heththesw&#257;mi
and some recite the following prayer. &ldquo;May all good acts be
remembered, and all bad ones be forgotten. Though there may be a
thousand and one sins, may I reach the feet of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following further information in connection with the Baireganni
festival is given by Bishop Whitehead. &ldquo;The people from other
villages offer money, rice, fruits, umbrellas of gold or silver for the
goddess, cloths, and buffaloes. The buffaloes are never killed, but
remain as the property of the temple. The p&#363;j&#257;ri calls the
representatives of one village, and tells them what Hethesw&#257;mi
says to him, <i>e.g.</i>, &lsquo;This year you will have good [or bad]
crops; cholera or small-pox, good [or bad] rain, etc.&rsquo; As the
people present their offerings, they prostrate themselves, kneeling
down and touching the ground with their foreheads, and the
p&#363;j&#257;ri gives them some flowers, which they wear in their
hair. The people and the p&#363;j&#257;ri play on the kombu [horn], and
ring bells while the offerings are being made. After the offerings have
finished, all the men dance, in two companies, in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>front of
the temple, one shouting &lsquo;How-ko, How-ko,&rsquo; and the other
&lsquo;Is-h&#333;li.&rsquo; The dance was taught them by the Todas, and
the words are Toda.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">Badagas Making Fire.</p>
</div>
<p>In connection with the Jadesw&#257;mi festival the ceremony of
walking through fire [burning embers] is carried out at
M&#275;l&#363;r, Tang&#257;lu, Mainel&#275;, Jakkan&#257;re,
Ten&#257;d, and Nidugala. At M&#275;l&#363;r and Tang&#257;lu, the
temples belong to the H&#257;ruvas, who carry out all the details of
ceremony. The temple at Ten&#257;d is owned by the Udayas, by whom the
ceremonial is performed. In other places, the celebrants are Badagas.
The festival is observed, on an elaborate scale, at Nidugala during the
month of January. All those who are going to walk over the burning
embers fast for eight days, and go through the rite on the ninth day.
For its performance, Monday is considered an auspicious day. The omens
are taken by boiling two pots of milk side by side on two hearths. If
the milk overflows uniformly on all sides, the crops will be abundant
for all the villages. But, if it flows over on one side only, there
will be plentiful crops for villages on that side only. The space over
which the embers are spread is said to be about five yards long, and
three yards broad. But, in some places, <i>e.g.</i>, Jakkan&#257;re and
M&#275;l&#363;r, it is circular as at the Muhammadan fire-walking
ceremony. For making the embers, the wood of <i lang="la-x-bio">Eugenia
Jambolana</i> and <i lang="la-x-bio">Phyllanthus Emblica</i> are used.
For boiling the milk, and setting fire to the wood, a light obtained by
friction must be used. The process is known as niligolu, or upright
stick. The vertical stick is made of a twig of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Rhodomyrtus tomentosus</i>, which is rotated in a socket in
a long thick piece of a bough of <i lang="la-x-bio">Debregeasia
velutina</i>, in which a row of sockets has been made. The rotation is
produced by a cord passed several times round the vertical stick, of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>which each end is pulled alternately. The
horizontal block is pressed firmly on the ground by the toes of a man,
who presses a half cocoanut shell down on the top of the vertical
stick, so as to force it down into the socket. A Badaga, who failed in
an attempt to demonstrate the making of fire by this method, gave as an
excuse that he was under worldly pollution, from which he would be free
at the time of the fire-walking ceremony. Though the Badagas make fire
by friction, reference is made in their folk legends, not to this mode
of obtaining fire, but to chakkamukki (flint and steel), which is
repeatedly referred to in connection with cremation. After the milk
boiling ceremonial, the p&#363;j&#257;ri, tying bells on his legs,
approaches the fire pit, carrying milk freshly drawn from a cow, which
has calved for the first time, and flowers of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Rhododendron arboreum</i>, <i lang="la-x-bio">Leucas
aspera</i>, or jasmine. After doing p&#363;ja, he throws the flowers on
the embers, and they should remain unscorched for a few seconds. He
then pours some of the milk over the embers, and no hissing sound
<span class="corr" id="xd21e9336" title="Source: shoud">should</span>
be produced. The omens being propitious, he walks over the glowing
embers, followed by an Udaya, and the crowd of celebrants, who, before
going through the ordeal, count the hairs on their feet. If any are
singed, it is a sign of approaching ill fortune, or even death. In an
account of the fire-walking ceremony, in 1902, it is noted that
&ldquo;the Badagas strongly repudiate the insinuation of preparing
their feet to face the fire ordeal. It is done to propitiate
Jeddaysw&#257;mi, to whom vows are invoked, in token of which they grow
one twist or plait of hair, which is treasured for years, and finally
cut off as an offering to Jeddaysw&#257;mi. Numbers of Chettis were
catering to the crowd, offering their wares, bangles, gay-coloured
handkerchiefs, as well as edibles. The Kotas supplied the music, and an
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>ancient patriarch worked himself up to a high
pitch of inspiration, and predicted all sorts of good things for the
Badagas with regard to the ensuing season and crops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following legend, relating to the fire-walking ceremony, is
recorded by Bishop Whitehead. &ldquo;When they first began to perform
the ceremony fifty or sixty years ago, they were afraid to walk over
the fire. Then the stone image of Mah&#257;linga Sw&#257;mi turned into
a snake, and made a hole through the temple wall. It came out, and
crawled over the fire, and then went back to the temple. Then their
fear vanished, and they walked over the embers. The hole is still to be
seen in the temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the fire-walking ceremony at M&#275;l&#363;r, the following
account is given in the Gazetteer of the N&#299;lgiris. &ldquo;It takes
place on the Monday after the March new moon, just before the
cultivation season begins, and is attended by Badagas from all over
M&#275;rkun&#257;d. The inhabitants of certain villages (six in
number), who are supposed to be the descendants of an early Badaga
named Guruvajja, have first, however, to signify through their
Gottuk&#257;rs, or headmen, that the festival may take place; and the
Gottuk&#257;rs choose three, five, or seven men to walk through the
fire. On the day appointed, the fire is lit by certain Badaga priests
and a Kurumba. The men chosen by the Gottuk&#257;rs then bathe, adorn
themselves with sandal, do obeisance to the Udayas of Udayarhatti near
K&#275;ti, who are specially invited and feasted; pour into the
adjacent stream milk from cows which have calved for the first time
during the year; and, in the afternoon, throw more milk and some
flowers from the Mah&#257;lingasv&#257;mi temple into the fire pit, and
then walk across it. Earth is next thrown on the embers, and they walk
across <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>twice more. A general feast closes the ceremony,
and next day the first ploughings are done, the Kurumba sowing the
first seeds, and the priests the next lot. Finally, a net is brought.
The priest of the temple, standing over it, puts up prayers for a
favourable agricultural season; two fowls are thrown into it, and a
pretence is made of spearing them; and then it is taken and put across
some game path, and some wild animal (a s&#257;mbhar deer if possible)
is driven into it, slain, and divided among the villagers. This same
custom of annually killing a s&#257;mbhar is also observed at other
villages on the plateau, and in 1883 and 1894 special orders were
passed to permit of its being done during the close season. Latterly,
disputes about precedence in the matter of walking through the fire at
M&#275;l&#363;r have been carried as far as the civil courts, and the
two factions celebrate the festival separately in alternate years. A
fire-walking ceremony also takes place annually at the Jadayasv&#257;mi
temple in Jakkan&#275;ri under the auspices of a Siv&#257;ch&#257;ri
Badaga. It seems to have originally had some connection with
agricultural prospects, as a young bull is made to go partly across the
fire-pit before the other devotees, and the owners of young cows which
have had their first calves during the year take precedence of others
in the ceremony, and bring offerings of milk, which are sprinkled over
the burning embers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Sakalathi festival, in the month of October, Badagas, towards
evening, throw on the roofs of their houses flowers of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Plectranthus Wightii</i>, <i lang="la-x-bio">Crotalaria
obtecta</i>, <i lang="la-x-bio">Lobelia nicotian&oelig;folia</i>,
<i lang="la-x-bio">Achyranthes aspera</i>, and <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Leucas aspera</i>. On the following day, they clean their
houses, and have a feast. In the afternoon, numbers of them may be seen
in the streets drawing in front of their houses pictures in wood-ashes
of buffaloes, bulls, cows, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>ploughs, stars, sun and moon,
snakes, lizards, etc. They then go into their houses, and wash their
hands. Taking up in his clean hands a big cake, on which are placed a
little rice and butter, the Badaga puts on it three wicks steeped in
castor oil, and lights them. The cake is then waved round the heads of
all the children of the house taken to a field, and thrown therein with
the words &ldquo;Sakalathi has come.&rdquo; The cake-thrower returns
home, and prostrates himself before a lamp placed in the inner room,
and repeats a long formula, composed of the various synonyms of
Siva.</p>
<p>In the month of November, a festival called Dodda Habba (big feast)
is celebrated. In the afternoon, rice is cooked in whey within the
h&#257;g&#333;ttu, and eaten on m&#299;nige leaves. Throughout the day
the villagers play at various ball games.</p>
<p>A festival, which is purely local, is celebrated near Konakore in
honour of Mahangk&#257;li. A buffalo is led to the side of a precipice,
killed by a Kurumba with a spear, and thrown over the edge thereof.
There is a legend that, in olden days, a p&#363;j&#257;ri used to put a
stick in the crevice of a rock, and, on removing it, get the value of a
buffalo in fanams (gold coins). But, on one occasion, he put the stick
in a second time, in the hopes of gaining more money. No money,
however, was forthcoming and, as a punishment for his greed, he died on
the spot.</p>
<p>All Badaga villages, except those of the Udayas, have a hut, called
holagudi, for the exclusive use of women during their monthly periods.
A few months before a girl is expected to reach puberty, she is sent to
the holagudi, on a Friday, four or five days before the new moon day.
This is done lest, in the ordinary course of events, the first
menstruation should commence on an inauspicious day. The girl remains
in the holagudi one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103"
name="pb103">103</a>]</span>night, and returns home on the following
day clad in new cloths, leaving the old ones in the hut. When she
arrives at her house, she salutes all the people who are there, and
receives their blessing. On Sunday she goes to the houses of her
relations, where she is given kadalai (<i lang="la-x-bio">Cicer
arietinum</i>) and other food. She may not enter the inner apartment of
her house until she has seen the crescent moon. Badaga women observe
five days menstrual pollution. If a woman discovers her condition
before washing her face in the early morning, that day is included in
the pollution period. Otherwise, the period must be prolonged over six
days. On the third day she bathes in cold water, using the bark of
<i lang="la-x-bio">Pouzolzia</i> (thor&#275;k&#333;lu), and on the
fourth day is allowed a change of clothing after a bath. On this day
she leaves the hut, and passes a portion of the night in the verandah
of her house. After cooking and eating her evening meal, she bathes,
and enters the outer room. Early on the following morning, the spot
which she has occupied is cleaned, and she bathes in a stream.
Returning home, she eats her food in the outer room, where she remains
till next morning. Even children may not be touched by a menstruating
woman. If, by chance, this happens, the child must be washed to remove
the pollution, before it can be handled by others. This restriction is
apparently not observed by any other tribe or caste.</p>
<p>Writing concerning marriage among the Badagas, Harkness
states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9383src" href="#xd21e9383" name=
"xd21e9383src">12</a> that &ldquo;it is said to be common for one who
is in want of labourers to promise his daughter in marriage to the son
or other relative of a neighbour not in circumstances so flourishing as
himself. And, these engagements being entered into, the intended
bridegroom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>serves the father of his betrothed as one of his
own family till the girl comes of age, when the marriage is
consummated, and he becomes a partner in the general property of the
family of his father-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man may marry a girl belonging to the same village as himself, if
he and she are not members of the same exogamous sept. In most cases,
however, all the inhabitants of a village are of the same sept, and a
man has to take as his wife a girl from a village other than his
own.</p>
<p>Among all sections of the Badagas, adult marriage is the general
rule, though infant marriage is also practised. Marriage is preceded by
a simple form of courtship, but the consent of the parents to the union
is necessary. A girl does not suffer in reputation if she is rejected
by a number of suitors, before she finally settles down. Except among
the Udayas, the marriage ceremony is of a very simple nature. A day or
two before that fixed for taking the girl to the house of her
husband-elect, the latter proceeds to her village, accompanied by his
brothers, who, as a token of respect, touch the feet of all the Badagas
who are assembled. The bride is taken to the house of the bridegroom,
accompanied by the Kota band. Arrived there, she stands at the
entrance, and her mother-in-law or sister-in-law brings water in a
vessel, and pours it into her hands thrice. Each time she lets the
water fall over her feet. The mother-in-law then ties round her neck a
string of beads (m&#257;le mani), and leads her to the outer room
(edumane), where cooked s&#257;mai (<i lang="la-x-bio">Panicum
miliare</i>) and milk is given to her. This she pretends to eat, and
the bridegroom&rsquo;s sister gives her water to wash her hands with.
The bride and two married women or virgins (preferably the
bridegroom&rsquo;s sisters) go to a stream in procession, accompanied
by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>Kota musicians, and bring therefrom water for
cooking purposes in decorated new pots. The bride then salutes all her
new relations, and they in turn give her their blessing. The ceremonial
concludes with a feast, at the conclusion of which, in some cases, the
bride and bridegroom sit on the raised verandah (pial), and receive
presents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though,&rdquo; a correspondent writes, &ldquo;the Badaga is
simple, and his wants are few, he cannot resist the temptation of wine
and women. The Badaga woman can change husbands as often as she pleases
by a simple system of divorce, and can also carry on with impunity
intimacy within the pale of her own community. It is not uncommon to
find Badaga women changing husbands, so long as youth and vigour tempt
them to do so, and confining themselves eventually to the last
individual, after age and infirmity have made their mark, and render
such frolics inexpedient.&rdquo; A former Magistrate of the
N&#299;lgiris informs me that he tried more than one case, in which a
married man filed a complaint against another man for kidnapping or
enticing away his wife for immoral purposes. The father of the woman
was always charged as an abetter, and pleaded that, as no pariyam
(bride price) had been paid by the husband, though he and the woman
lived together as man and wife, no criminal offence could be proved
against either the father or the abductor. Polygamy is permitted, and
the plurality of wives is a gain to the husband, as each wife becomes a
bread-winner, and supports her children, and the man makes each wife
superintend one department of the day&rsquo;s work. Remarriage of
widows is very common, and a widow may marry the brother of her
deceased husband. It is said to be etiquette among the Badagas that,
when a woman&rsquo;s husband is away, she <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>should be accessible
to her brothers-in-law. Instances occur, in which the husband is much
younger than his wife, who, until he has reached maturity, cohabits
with her paternal aunt&rsquo;s son, or some one whom she may have a
fancy for. The marriage ceremony of the Udayas is carried out on an
elaborate scale, and is based on the type of ceremonial which is
carried out by some castes in the plains. Before dawn on the marriage
day, the brothers and cousins of the bridegroom go, accompanied by some
Udayas and the Kota band, to the forest, whence they bring two sticks
of <i lang="la-x-bio">Mimusops hexandra</i>, to do duty as the
milk-posts. The early hour is selected, to avoid the chance of coming
across inauspicious objects. The sticks should be cut off the tree at a
single stroke of the bill-hook, and they may not be laid flat on the
ground, but placed on a blanket spread thereon. The Udayas, who joined
in the procession, collect twelve posts of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Mimusops</i> as supports for the marriage booth (pandal). In
front of the house, which is to be the scene of the wedding, two pits
are dug, into which cow-dung water is poured. The p&#363;j&#257;ri does
p&#363;ja to the milk-posts by offering sugar-cane, jaggery (crude
sugar), etc., and ties two threads thereto. The posts are then placed
in the pits by five people&mdash;the parents of the bridal couple and
the priest. The booth, and dais or enclosure, are then erected close to
the milk-posts. On the second day, the bridegroom&rsquo;s party,
attended by Kota musicians, dressed up in dancing costume, go to the
house of the bride, where a feast is held. The bride then salutes a
lamp, and prostrates herself at the feet of her parents, who bless her,
saying &ldquo;May your body and hands soon be filled (<i>i.e.</i>, may
you have a child), and may your life be prosperous.&rdquo; The bride is
taken in procession to the house of the bridegroom, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>accompanied by some Udayas, and a Toreya
carrying a bag of rice. At the entrance to the house she is
blindfolded, and her mother-in-law pours water over her feet, and waves
coloured water (&#257;rathi) in front of her. She then enters the
house, right foot foremost, and sits on a mat. Three married women,
nearly related to the bridegroom, proceed, with the Kota musicians, to
a stream, carrying three pots decorated with leaves of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Leucas aspera</i>. The priest does p&#363;ja, and the pots
are filled with water, and brought back in procession to the marriage
dais. The water is poured into three vessels placed thereon three times
by each of the three women. Within the marriage enclosure, two raised
platforms are set up by a Toreya. The bridegroom, after going round the
enclosure three times with his brothers and sisters, enters it, and
bathes with the water contained in the vessels. He then dresses himself
in new clothes, and is carried to the outer room by his maternal uncle.
The bride is then treated in like manner, but is taken to the inner
room. At a fixed auspicious hour, the bridal couple repair to the
enclosure, where the bridegroom stands on a mat. A screen is held up by
four or five men between him and the bride, who stands facing him,
while the priest ties the ends of their clothes together. They then
link their little fingers together, the screen is removed, and they
seat themselves on the mat. The bridegroom&rsquo;s sister brings a tray
with a mass of rice scooped out into a cavity to hold gh&#299; for
feeding a lighted wick (annadha &#257;rathi) on it, and, placing it
before the bridal pair, sits down. The t&#257;li, consisting of a
golden disc, is worshipped by the priest, and given to the bridegroom,
who ties it on to the bride&rsquo;s neck. In some places it is tied by
four or five elders, belonging to different villages, who are not
widowers. The contracting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>couple then put on wreaths called
sammandha m&#257;lai, or wreaths establishing relationship, and the
wrist threads are tied on. The bride&rsquo;s sister brings some rice
and milk in a cup, into which the linked fingers of the bride and
bridegroom are thrust. Taking up some of the rice, they put it into
each other&rsquo;s mouths three times. After they have washed their
hands, the maternal uncle or priest asks them if they have seen
Aranjoti (the pole-star), and they reply in the affirmative. On the
third day, presents are given to the newly-married couple, and the
wrist threads are removed. Going to a stream, they perform a mimic
ceremony of sowing, and scatter cotton and rice seed in two small pans
made by a Toreya with cow-dung. Widow remarriage is permitted among the
Udayas, and a widow may marry a cousin, but not her dead
husband&rsquo;s brother. At the marriage ceremony, a priest makes a
mark with sacred ashes on the foreheads of the contracting couple, and
announces the fact of their union.</p>
<p>It is noted by Dr. Rivers that &ldquo;Breeks has stated that the
Toda custom is that the house shall pass to the youngest son. It seems
quite clear that this is wrong, and that this custom is absolutely
unknown among the Todas. It is, however, a Badaga custom, and among
them I was told that it is due to the fact that, as the sons of a
family grow up and marry, they leave the house of the parents and build
houses elsewhere. It is the duty of the youngest son to dwell with his
parents, and support them as long as they live, and, when they die, he
continues to live in the paternal home, of which he becomes the
owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ceremony is performed in the seventh month of a woman&rsquo;s
first pregnancy, which is important, inasmuch as it seals the marriage
contract, and, after its performance, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>divorce can only be
obtained through the decree of the panch&#257;yat (tribal council).
Moreover, if it has not been performed, a man cannot claim the
paternity of the child. The ceremony is called kanni kattodu or kanni
h&#257;kodu (thread tying or throwing). The husband and wife are seated
in the midst of those who have assembled for the occasion, and the
former asks his father-in-law whether he may throw the thread round his
wife&rsquo;s neck, and, having received permission, proceeds to do so.
If he gets the thread, which must have no knots in it, entangled in the
woman&rsquo;s bunch of hair (kondai), which is made large for the
occasion by the addition of false hair, he is fined three rupees. On
the day of the ceremony, the man and his wife are supposed to be under
pollution, and sit in the verandah to receive presents. The mats used
by them for sleeping on are cleaned on the following morning, and they
get rid of the pollution by bathing.</p>
<p>A first confinement must not take place within the house, and the
verandah is converted into a lying-in chamber, from which the woman is,
after delivery, removed to the outer apartment, where she remains till
she is free from pollution by catching sight of the crescent moon. If a
woman has been delivered at her father&rsquo;s house, she returns to
the home of her husband within a month of the birth of the child on an
auspicious day. On arrival there, the infant is placed near the feet of
an old man standing by a lamp within the milk-house. Placing his right
hand over the head of the infant, the old man blesses it, and a feast
is held, before the commencement of which two cups, one containing
milk, and the other cooked rice, are produced. All the relations take
up a little of the milk and rice, and touch the tongue of the baby with
them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>A child receives its name on the seventh, ninth, or eleventh day. A
sumptuous meal is given to the community, and the grandfather
(paternal, if possible) milks a cow, and pours the milk into a brass
cup placed in the milk-house. With it a little cooked s&#257;mai grain
is mixed. The babe is washed with water brought from a stream; marked
on the forehead with sacred ashes; a turmeric-dyed thread is tied round
its waist; a silver or iron bangle placed on its wrists; and a silver
bead tied by a thread round its neck. Thus decorated, the infant is
taken up by the oldest man of the village who is not a widower, who
gives it a name, which has already been chosen. The elder, and the
child&rsquo;s parents and grandparents then place a little milk in its
mouth.</p>
<p>Children, both male and female, go through a shaving ceremony,
usually when they are seven months old. The infant is seated in the lap
of a Badaga, and, after water has been applied to its head by a Badaga
or a barber, the maternal uncle removes some of the hair with a razor,
and then hands it over to another Badaga or a barber to complete the
operation.</p>
<p>Of the death rites as carried out by the Badaga sub-division, the
following note was recorded during a visit to Kotagiri. When death is
drawing near, a gold coin, called V&#299;rar&#257;ya hana or fanam,
dipped in butter or gh&#299;, is given to the dying man to swallow. If
he is too far gone to be capable of swallowing, the coin is, according
to Mr. Natesa Sastri, tied round the arm. But our informants told us
that this is not done at the present day. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; Mr. Gover
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9435src" href="#xd21e9435" name=
"xd21e9435src">13</a> &ldquo;the tiny coin slips down, well. He will
need both gold and gh&#299;, the one to sustain his strength in the
dark journey to the river of death, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>other to fee the
guardian of the fairy-like bridge that spans the dreaded tide. If sense
remains to the wretched man, he knows that now his death is nigh.
Despair and the gold make recovery impossible, and there are none who
have swallowed the Birianhana, and yet have lived. If insensibility or
deathly weakness make it impossible for the coin to pass the thorax, it
is carefully bound in cloth, and tied to the right arm, so that there
may be nought to hinder the passage of a worthy soul into the regions
of the blessed.&rdquo; The giving of the coin to the dying man is
apparently an important item, and, in the Badaga folk-tales, a man on
the point of death is made to ask for a V&#299;rar&#257;ya fanam. When
life is extinct, the corpse is kept within the house until the erection
of the funeral car (gudikattu) is completed. Though Gover states that
the burning must not be delayed more than twenty-four hours, at the
present day the Badagas postpone the funeral till all the near
relations have assembled, even if this necessitates the keeping of the
corpse for two or three days. Cremation may take place on any day,
except Tuesday. News of a death is conveyed to distant hamlets (hattis)
by a Toreya, who is paid a rupee for his services. On approaching a
hamlet, he removes his turban, to signify the nature of his errand,
and, standing on the side of a hill, yells out &ldquo;Dho! Dho! who is
in the hamlet?&rdquo; Having imparted his news, he proceeds on his
journey to the next hamlet. On the morning of the day fixed for the
funeral, the corpse is taken on a charpoy or native cot to an open
space, and a buffalo led thrice round it. The right hand of the corpse
is then lifted up, and passed over the horns of the buffalo. A little
milk is drawn, and poured into the mouth of the corpse. Prior to this
ceremony, two or three buffaloes may be let loose, and one of them
captured, after the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112"
name="pb112">112</a>]</span>manner of the Todas, brought near the
corpse, and conducted round the cot. The funeral car is built up in
five to eleven tiers, decorated with cloths and streamers, and one tier
must be covered with black chintz. At the funeral of a young man, the
Rev. A. C. Clayton noticed that the car was surmounted by a flag, and
hung about with bread, oranges, plantains, and the bag containing the
books which the youth had used in the Basel Mission School.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9443src" href="#xd21e9443" name=
"xd21e9443src">14</a> By the poorer members of the community the car is
replaced by a cot covered with cloth, and surmounted by five umbrellas.
Immediately after the buffalo ceremony, the corpse is carried to the
car, and placed in the lowest storey thereof, washed, and dressed in
coat and turban. A new dhupati (coarse cloth) is wrapped round it. Two
silver coins (Japanese yens or rupees) are stuck on the forehead.
Beneath the cot are placed a crowbar, and baskets containing cakes,
parched paddy, tobacco, chick pea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>), jaggery and
s&#257;mai flour. A number of women, relations and friends of the dead
man, then make a rush to the cot, and, sitting on it round the corpse,
keep on waiting, while a woman near its head rings a bell. When one
batch is tired, it is replaced by another. Badaga men then pour in in
large numbers, and salute the corpse by touching the head, Toreyas and
female relations touching the feet. Of those who salute, a few place
inside the dhupati a piece of white cloth with red and yellow stripes,
which has been specially prepared for the purpose. All then proceed to
dance round the car to the music of the Kota band, near male relations
removing their turban or woollen night cap, as a mark of respect,
during the first three revolutions. Most of the male dancers are
dressed up in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>gaudy petticoats and smart turbans. &ldquo;No
woman,&rdquo; Mr. Natesa Sastri writes, &ldquo;mingles in the funeral
dance if the dead person is a man, but, if the deceased is a woman, one
old woman, the nearest relative of the dead, takes part in it.&rdquo;
But, at the funerals of two men which we witnessed, a few women danced
together with the men. Usually the tribesmen continue to arrive until 2
or 3 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> Relations collect outside the
village, and advance in a body towards the car, some, especially the
sons-in-law of the dead man, riding on ponies, some of them carrying
s&#257;mai grain. As they approach the car, they shout &ldquo;Ja! hoch;
Ja! hoch.&rdquo; The Muttu Kotas bring a double iron sickle with
imitation buffalo horns on the tip, which is placed, with a hatchet,
buguri (flute), and walking stick, on the car or on the ground beside
it. When all are assembled, the cot is carried to an open space between
the house and the burning-ground, followed by the car and a party of
women carrying the baskets containing grain, etc. The car is then
stripped of its trappings, and hacked to pieces. The widow is brought
close to the cot, and removes her nose ornament (elemukkuthi), and
other jewels. At both the funerals which we witnessed, the widow had a
narrow strip of coloured chintz over her shoulders. Standing near the
corpse, she removed a bit of wire from her ear-rings, a lock of hair,
and a palm leaf roll from the lobe of the ear, and tied them up in the
cloth of her dead husband. After her, the sisters of the dead man cut
off a lock of hair, and, in like manner, tied it in the cloth. Women
attached to a man by illegitimate ties sometimes also cut off a lock of
hair, and, tying it to a twig of <i>Dodon&aelig;a viscosa</i>, place it
inside the cloth. Very impressive is the recitation, or after-death
confession of a dead man&rsquo;s sins by an elder of the tribe standing
at the head of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114"
name="pb114">114</a>]</span>corpse, and rapidly chanting the following
lines, or a variation thereof, while he waves his right hand during
each line towards the feet. The reproduction of the recitation in my
phonograph never failed to impress the daily audience of Badagas, Kotas
and Todas.</p>

<p>The recitation is repeated thrice, and a few Badagas repeat the last
words of each line after the elder. It was noticed by the Rev. A. C.
Clayton that, during the recitation, the people surrounded the bier on
three sides, leaving a lane open to the west. The sins of the dead man
were transferred to another as sin-bearer, and finally passed away down
the lane. As the ceremony witnessed by us differs materially from the
account thereof given by Gover nearly forty years ago, I may quote his
description. &ldquo;By a conventional mode of expression, the sum total
of sins a man may do is said to be thirteen hundred. Admitting that the
deceased has committed them all, the performer cries aloud &lsquo;Stay
not their flight to God&rsquo;s pure feet.&rsquo; As he closes, the
whole assembly chants aloud &lsquo;Stay not their flight.&rsquo; Again
the performer enters into details, and cries &lsquo;He killed the
crawling snake. It is a sin.&rsquo; In a moment the last word is caught
up, and all the people cry &lsquo;It is a sin.&rsquo; As they shout,
the performer lays his hand upon the calf. The sin is transferred to
the calf. Thus the whole catalogue is gone through in this impressive
way. But this is not enough. As the last shout &lsquo;Let all be
well&rsquo; dies away, the performer gives place to another, and again
confession is made, and all the people shout &lsquo;It is a sin.&rsquo;
A third time it is done. Then, still in solemn silence, the calf is let
loose. Like the Jewish scapegoat, it may never be used for secular
work.&rdquo; Dr. Rivers writes that &ldquo;the Badagas let loose a calf
at a funeral, to bear the sins of the deceased. It is possible that the
calf in the Toda ceremony may have the same significance. If so, the
practice has not improbably been borrowed, and the fact that the bell
which is hung on the neck of the calf is kept by Kotas or Badagas
suggests that the whole incident may have been borrowed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>by
the Todas from one or other of these races.&rdquo; At the funerals, of
which we were spectators, no calf was brought near the corpse, and the
celebrants of the rites were satisfied with the mere mention by name of
a calf, which is male or female according to the sex of the deceased.
At the funeral witnessed by the Rev. A. C. Clayton, a cow-buffalo was
led three times round the bier, and a little of its milk, drawn at the
time, put into the mouth of the corpse. Then a buffalo calf was led
thrice round the bier, and the dead man&rsquo;s hand laid on its head.
By this act, the calf was supposed to receive all the sins of the
deceased. It was then driven away to a great distance, that it might
contaminate no one, and it was said that it would never be sold, but
looked on as a dedicated sacred animal. If a dead man leaves a widow in
a state of pregnancy, who has not performed the kanni kattodu or
marriage thread ceremony, this must be gone through before the corpse
is taken to the pyre, in order to render the child legitimate. The
pregnant woman is, at the time of the funeral, brought close to the
cot, and a near relation of the deceased, taking up a cotton thread,
twisted in the form of a necklace without any knots, throws it round
her neck. Sometimes the hand of the corpse is lifted up with the
thread, and made to place it round the neck. At the funeral of the
young man, Mr. Clayton saw this ceremony performed on his pregnant
wife. After a turmeric-dyed cord had been taken from the hands of the
corpse and tied round her neck, she was again brought to the side of
the bier, and her ear-rings, nose ornaments, and other articles of
jewellery, were removed in token that she had become a widow. Soon
after the recitation of sins, all the agnates go to the house of the
dead man, at the entrance to which a gunny-bag is spread, whereon a
small <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>quantity of paddy is poured, and a few culms of
<i lang="la-x-bio">Cynodon Dactylon</i> and a little cow-dung are
placed on it. The eldest of the agnates, sickle in hand, takes some of
the paddy, and moves on, raising both hands to his forehead. The other
agnates then do the same, and proceed in Indian file, males in front
and females in the rear, to the corpse. Round it they walk, men from
left to right, and women in the reverse direction, and at the end of
each circuit put some of the paddy on its face. The cot is then carried
to the burning-ground, a woman heading the procession, and shaking the
end of her cloth all the way. The corpse is laid on the pyre with its
feet to the south, and the pyre lighted by the eldest son standing at
the head. The sticks of which the car was constructed are added to the
fuel, of which the pyre is built up. In some places the son, when
lighting the pyre, repeats the words &ldquo;Being begotten by my father
and mother, I, in the presence of all and the D&#275;va, set fire at
the head after the manner of my ancestors and forefathers.&rdquo; The
Rev. A. C. Clayton records that, before the procession started for the
burning-ground, some female relatives of the dead man tied locks of
their hair round the toes of the corpse, and others went three times
round the bier. On the day following the funeral, the bereaved family
distribute rice to all the Badagas of the hamlet, and all the near
relations of the deceased go to the burning-ground, taking with them
two new pots. The fire is extinguished, and the fragments of the bones
are collected. A tray is made of the fronds of the bracken fern
(<i>Pteris aquilina</i>) covered with a cloth, on which the bones are
placed together with culms of <i>Cynodon</i> grass and gh&#299;. The
Badagas of the hamlet who are younger than the deceased salute the
bones by touching them, and a few men, including the chief mourner,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>hold the tray, and convey it to the bone pit,
which every hamlet possesses. Into it the bones are thrown, while an
elder repeats the words &ldquo;Become united with the line of your
relations, with your class, and with the big people,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;May the young and old who have died, may all those who have died
from time immemorial up to the present time, mingle in one.&rdquo; When
the pit has been closed up, all return to the spot where the body was
burnt, and, clearing a space, make a puddle, round which they stand,
and throw into it a handful of korali (<i>Setaria italica</i>),
uttering the words &ldquo;May deaths cease; may evils cease; may good
prevail in the village; in virtue of the good deeds of the ancestors
and forefathers, may this one mingle with them.&rdquo; This ceremony
concluded, they repair to a stream, where a member of the bereaved
family shaves a Toreya partially or completely. Some take a razor, and,
after removing a patch of hair, pass the Toreya on to a barber. All the
agnates are then shaved by a Badaga or a barber. The chief mourner then
prostrates himself on the ground, and is blessed by all. He and the
Toreya proceed to the house of the deceased. Taking a three-pronged
twig of <i>Rhodomyrtus tomentosus</i>, and placing a m&#299;nige
(<i>Argyreia</i>) leaf on the prongs, he thrusts it into a rubbish heap
near the house. He then places a small quantity of s&#257;mai grain,
called street food, on the leaf, and, after sprinkling it thrice with
water, goes away.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e9644width" id="pl1-119"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">Badaga Funeral Car.</p>
</div>
<p>It was noted by Harkness that, at the burning-ground, the son or
representative of the deceased dropped a little grain into the mouth of
the corpse, carrying in his left hand a small bar of iron, which is
supposed to have a repulsive power over the spirits that hover about
the dead. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>The final death ceremonies, or korambu, are celebrated on a Sunday.
Towards evening the house of the deceased is cleansed with cow-dung,
and Badaga men assemble therein, sending away all women. The chief
mourner, accompanied by two Badagas carrying new pots, proceeds to a
stream, where the pots are cleaned with cow-dung, and rubbed over with
culms of <i lang="la-x-bio">Andropogon Sch&oelig;nanthus</i>. They are
then filled with water, carried to the house, and deposited in the
milk-room. At the entrance to the inner apartment, five agnates stand,
holding a circular bamboo tray (kerachi) made of plaited bamboo, on
which the chief mourner pours a small quantity of paddy, and spreads it
with a sickle. The widow and other female relations come near, and cry.
A few sickles or knives (preferably those which were used at the
funeral) are placed on the tray, which is saluted by all the Badagas
present. The paddy is husked in a mortar, and the rice cooked with
<i lang="la-x-bio">Dolichos Lablab</i>, <i lang="la-x-bio">Cicer
arietinum</i>, and other pulses, without the addition of salt. Early on
the following morning, the eldest son, taking a small quantity of the
rice to the roof of the house, places seven balls made therefrom on
plantain or m&#299;nige leaves, and recites the names of the male and
female ancestors and forefathers, his mother, father, and brothers. The
remainder of the rice is eaten by relations. In some places, the whole
of the rice is divided into seven balls, and taken outside the house.
Water is sprinkled over the roof, and a portion of the rice thrown
thereon. Standing up before the assembled Badagas, an elder says
&ldquo;To-day we have acted up to the observances of our ancestors and
forefathers. New ones should not be considered as old, or old as new.
There is not a man carrying a head (wise man), or a woman carrying
breasts (wise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>woman). May he become united with the men of his
clan and caste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The funeral rites of the Udayas differ in some important details
from those of the Badaga sub-division. The buffalo catching, and
leading the animal round the corpse, are omitted. But a steer and
heifer are selected, and branded on the thigh, by means of a hot iron,
with the lingam and other emblems. Bedecked with cloths and jewels,
they are led to the side of the corpse, and made to stand on a blanket
spread on the ground. They are treated as if they were lingams, and
p&#363;ja is done to them by offering cocoanuts and betel leaves, and
throwing flowers over them. Round their necks kankanams (marriage
threads) are tied. They are made to turn so as to face away from the
corpse, and their tails are placed in the hands thereof. An elder then
proceeds with the recitation of the dead person&rsquo;s sins. The
Udayas bury their dead in a sitting posture in a cell dug out of the
side of the grave, and, like the Irulas, prefer to use a grave in which
a previous burial has taken place. At the four corners of the grave
they place in the ground a plant of <i lang="la-x-bio">Leucas
aspera</i>, and pass a cotton thread laterally and diagonally across
the grave, leaving out the side opposite the cell. Two men descend into
the grave, and deposit the corpse in its resting place with two lighted
lamps.</p>
<p>In 1905, an elaborate Badaga memorial ceremony for ancestors called
manavalai, which takes place at long intervals, was celebrated on the
N&#299;lgiris. I gather from the notes of a Native official that an
enormous car, called &#275;lu kudi t&#275;ru (seven-storeyed car) was
built of wood and bamboo, and decorated with silk and woollen fabrics,
flags, and umbrellas. Inside the ground floor were a cot with a
mattress and pillow, and the stem of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>a plantain tree. The
souls of the ancestors are supposed to be reclining on the cot, resting
their heads on the pillow, and chewing the plantain, while the
umbrellas protect them from the sun and rain. The ear ornaments of all
those who have died since the previous ceremony should be placed on the
cot. &ldquo;A Badaga fell and hurt himself during the erection of the
car. Whereupon, another Badaga became possessed, and announced that the
god was angry because a Kurumba had something to do with the building
of the structure. A council meeting was held, and the Kurumba fined
twenty-five rupees, which were credited to the god. Sixty-nine petty
bazars and three beer taverns had been opened for the convenience of
all classes of people that had assembled. One very old Badaga woman
said that she was twelve years old when the first European was carried
in a chair by the Todas, and brought up the gh&#257;t to the
N&#299;lgiris from Coimbatore. On Wednesday at 10 <span class=
"sc">A.M.</span> people from the adjoining villages were announced, and
the Kota band, with the village people, went forward, greeted them, and
brought them to the car. As each man approached it, he removed his
turban, stooped over the pillow and laid his head on it, and then went
to join the ring for the dance. The dancers wore skirts made of white
long-cloth, white and cream silks and satins with border of red and
blue trimming, frock dresses, and dressing-gowns, while the coats,
blouses, and jackets were of the most gaudy colours of silk, velvet,
velveteen, tweed, and home-spun. As each group of people arrived, they
went first to the temple door, saluted the god, and went to the
basement of the car to venerate the deceased, and then proceeded to
dance for an hour, received their supplies of rice, etc., and cleared
off. Thursday and Friday were the grandest <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>days. Nearly three thousand females, and six
thousand males, assembled on Thursday. To crown all the confusion,
there appeared nearly a thousand Badagas armed with new mamotis
(spades). They came on dancing for some distance, rushed into the
crowd, and danced round the car. These Badagas belonged to a gang of
public works, local fund, and municipal maistries. On the last day a
sheep was slaughtered in honour of the deity. The musicians throughout
the festivities were Kotas and Kurumbas. The dancing of the men of
three score showed that they danced to music, and the stepping was
admirable, while the dancing of young men did not show that they had
any idea of dancing, or either taste or knowledge of music. They were
merely skipping and jumping. This shows that the old art of the Badaga
dance is fast decaying.&rdquo; The cot is eventually burnt at the
burning-ground, as if it contained a corpse.</p>
<p>A kind of edible truffle (<i lang="la-x-bio">Mylitta
lapidescens</i>) is known as little man&rsquo;s bread on the
N&#299;lgiris. The Badaga legendary name for it is
P&#257;ndva-unna-buthi, or dwarf bundle of food,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e9684src" href="#xd21e9684" name="xd21e9684src">16</a>
<i>i.e.</i>, food of the dwarfs, who are supposed once to have
inhabited the N&#299;lgiris and built the p&#257;ndu k&#363;lis or
kistvaens.</p>
<p>The story goes that Lord Elphinstone, a former Governor of Madras,
was anxious to build a residence at Kaiti. But the Badagas, who had on
the desired site a sacred tree, would not part with the land. The
Governor&rsquo;s steward succeeded in making the Badaga headman drunk,
and secured, for a rental of thirty-five rupees annually, the site,
whereon a villa was built, which now belongs to the Basel
Mission.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9692src" href="#xd21e9692" name=

<p>In a recent work,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9698src" href=
"#xd21e9698" name="xd21e9698src">18</a> Mr. A. H. Keane, in a note on
the &ldquo;Dravidian Aborigines,&rdquo; writes as follows. &ldquo;All
stand on the very lowest rung of the social ladder, being rude hillmen
without any culture strictly so called, and often betraying marked
negroid characters, as if they were originally Negroes or Negritos,
later assimilated in some respects to their Dravidian conquerors. As
they never had a collective racial name, they should now be called, not
Dravidians or proto-Dravidians, but rather pre-Dravidians, as more
collectively indicating their true ethnical relations. Such are the
Kotas, Irulas, Badagas, and Kurumbas.&rdquo; It may be pointed out that
the Badagas and Kotas of the N&#299;lgiri plateau are not &ldquo;wild
tribes,&rdquo; have no trace of negroid characters, and no affinities
with the Kurumbas and Irulas of the N&#299;lgiri slopes. The figures in

<p><b>Badagi.&mdash;</b>The carpenter sub-division of
P&#257;nch&#257;las.</p>
<p><b>Badh&#333;yi.&mdash;</b>The Badh&#333;yis are Oriya carpenters
and blacksmiths, of whom the former are known as Badh&#333;yi, and the
latter as Kom&#257;ro. These are not separate castes, and the two
sections both interdine and intermarry. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>The name Badh&#333;yi
is said to be derived from the Sanskrit vardhaki, which, in Oriya,
becomes bardhaki, and indicates one who changes the form, <i>i.e.</i>,
of timber. Korti, derived from korto, a saw, occurs as the name of a
section of the caste, the members of which are wood-sawyers. Socially,
the Badh&#333;yis occupy the same position as Doluvas, K&#257;linjis,
and various other agricultural classes, and they do not, like the Tamil
Kamm&#257;lans, claim to be Viswakarma Br&#257;hmans, descended from
Viswakarma, the architect of the gods.</p>
<p>The hereditary headman is called Mah&#257;r&#257;na, and, in some
places, there seem to be three grades of Mah&#257;r&#257;na, viz.,
Mah&#257;r&#257;na, Dondop&#257;to Mah&#257;r&#257;na, and Swangso
Mah&#257;r&#257;na. These headmen are assisted by a Bhollobhaya or
Dolob&#275;hara, and there is a further official called Agopothiria,
whose duty it is to eat with an individual who is re-admitted into the
caste after a council meeting. This duty is sometimes performed by the
Mah&#257;r&#257;na. Ordinary meetings of council are convened by the
Mah&#257;r&#257;na and Bhollobhaya. But, if a case of a serious nature
is to be tried, a special council meeting, called kulo panch&#257;yat,
is held in a grove or open space outside the village. All the
Mah&#257;r&#257;nas and other officers, and representatives of five
castes (panchap&#257;tako) equal or superior to the Badh&#333;yis in
the social scale, attend such a council. The complainant goes to the
Swangso Mah&#257;r&#257;na, and, giving him fifty areca nuts, asks him
to convene the council meeting. Punishment inflicted by the caste
council usually assumes the form of a fine, the amount of which depends
on the worldly prosperity of the delinquent, who, if very indigent, may
be let off with a reprimand and warning. Sometimes offences are
condoned by feeding Br&#257;hmans or the Badh&#333;yi community. Small
sums, collected as fines, are appropriated by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>headman, and large sums are set apart towards a
fund for meeting the marriage expenses of the poorer members of the
caste, and the expenditure in connection with kulo panch&#257;yats.</p>
<p>Concerning the marriage ceremonies, Mr. D. Mahanty writes as
follows. &ldquo;At a marriage among the Badh&#333;yis, and various
other castes in Ganjam, two pith crowns are placed on the head of the
bridegroom. On his way to the bride&rsquo;s house, he is met by her
pur&#333;hit (priest) and relations, and her barber washes his feet,
and presents him with a new yellow cloth, flowers, and kusa grass (also
called dharbha grass). When he arrives at the house, amid the
recitations of stanzas by the priest, the blowing of conch shells and
other music, the women of the bride&rsquo;s party make a noise called
hulu-huli, and shower kusa grass over him. At the marriage booth, the
bridegroom sits upon a raised &lsquo;altar,&rsquo; and the bride, who
arrives accompanied by his maternal uncle, pours salt, yellow-coloured
rice, and parched paddy (rice) over the head of the bridegroom, by
whose side she seats herself. One of the pith crowns is removed from
the bridegroom&rsquo;s forehead, and placed on that of the bride.
Various Br&#257;hmanical rites are then performed, and the
bride&rsquo;s father places her hand in that of the bridegroom. A
bundle of straw is now placed on the altar, on which the contracting
parties sit, the bridegroom facing east, and the bride west. The
pur&#333;hit rubs a little jaggery over the bridegroom&rsquo;s right
palm, joins it to the palm of the bride, and ties their two hands
together with a rope made of kusa grass (hasthagonti). A yellow cloth
is tied to the cloths which the bridal pair are wearing, and stretched
over their shoulders (gontiyala). The hands are then untied by a
married woman. Sr&#257;dha is performed for the propitiation of
ancestors, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>and the pur&#333;hit, repeating some mantrams
(prayers), blesses the pair by throwing yellow rice over them. On the
sixth day of the ceremony, the bridegroom runs away from the house of
his father-in-law, as if he was displeased, and goes to the house of a
relation in the same or an adjacent village. His brother-in-law, or
other male relation of the bride, goes in search of him, and, when he
has found him, rubs some jaggery over his face, and brings him
back.&rdquo; As an example of the stanzas recited by the pur&#333;hit,
the following may be cited:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">I have presented with my mind and word, and also with
kusa grass and water.</p>
<p>The witnesses of this are fire, Br&#257;hmans, women, relations, and
all the d&#275;vatas.</p>
<p>Forgive this presentable faithful maid.</p>
<p>I am performing the marriage according to the V&#275;dic rites.</p>
<p>Women are full of all kinds of faults. Forgive these faults.</p>
<p>Br&#257;hma is the god of this maid.</p>
<p>By the grace of the god Vasud&#275;va, I give to thee the
bridegroom.</p>
</div>
<p>The Badh&#333;yis are Paramarthos, and follow the Chaitanya form of
Vaishnavism. They further worship various village deities. The dead are
cremated. The corpse of a dead person is washed, not at the house, but
at the burning-ground.</p>
<p>The most common caste title is Mah&#257;r&#257;na. But, in some
zemind&#257;ris, such titles as Bindhani Rathno, and Bindhani
B&#363;shano, have been conferred by the zemindars on carpenters for
the excellence of their work.</p>
<p>The carpenters and blacksmiths hold in&#257;ms or rent-free lands
both under zemindars and under Government. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>In
return, they are expected to construct a car for the annual festival of
the village deity, at which, in most places, the car is burnt at the
conclusion of the festival. They have further to make agricultural
implements for the villagers, and, when officials arrive on circuit, to
supply tent-pegs, etc.</p>
<p><b>Bagata.&mdash;</b>The Bagatas, Bhakt&#257;s, or Baktas are a
class of Telugu fresh-water fishermen, who are said to be very expert
at catching fish with a long spear. It is noted, in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, that &ldquo;on the Dasara day they worship the fishing
baskets, and also (for some obscure reason) a kind of trident.&rdquo;
The trident is probably the fishing spear. Some of the Bagatas are hill
cultivators in the Agency tracts of Vizagapatam. They account for their
name by the tradition that they served with great devotion (bhakti) the
former rulers of Golgonda and M&#257;dugula, who made grants of land to
them in mokh&#257;sa tenure. Some of them are heads of hill villages.
The head of a single village is called a Pad&#257;l, and it may be
noted that Pad&#257;la occurs as an exogamous sept of the K&#257;pus,
of which caste it has been suggested that the Bagatas are an offshoot.
The overlord of a number of Pad&#257;ls styles himself N&#257;yak or
R&#257;ju, and a Mokh&#257;sadar has the title of Dora. It is recorded,
in the Census Report, 1871, that &ldquo;in the low country the
Bhakt&#257;s consider themselves to take the rank of soldiery, and
rather disdain the occupation of ryots (cultivators). Here, however (in
hill M&#257;dugulu in the Vizagapatam district), necessity has divested
them of such prejudices, and they are compelled to delve for their
daily bread. They generally, nevertheless, manage to get the K&#257;pus
to work for them, for they make poor farmers, and are unskilled in
husbandry.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129"
name="pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district, that
&ldquo;Matsya gundam (fish pool) is a curious pool on the Mach&#275;ru
(fish river) near the village of Matam, close under the great Yendrika
hill, 5,188 feet above the sea. A barrier of rocks runs right across
the river there, and the stream plunges into a great hole and vanishes
beneath this, reappearing again about a hundred yards lower down. Just
where it emerges from under the barrier, it forms a pool, which is
crowded with mahseer of all sizes. These are wonderfully tame, the
bigger ones feeding fearlessly from one&rsquo;s hand, and even allowing
their backs to be stroked. They are protected by the M&#257;dgole
zamindars&mdash;who on several grounds venerate all fish&mdash;and by
superstitious fears. Once, goes the story, a Brinj&#257;ri caught one
and turned it into curry, whereon the king of the fish solemnly cursed
him, and he and all his pack-bullocks were turned into rocks, which may
be seen there till this day. At Sivar&#257;tri, a festival occurs at
the little thatched shrine near by, the priest at which is a Bagata,
and part of the ritual consists in feeding the sacred fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1901, certain envious Bagatas looted one of the villages
of the Konda M&#257;las or hill Paraiyans, a pushing set of traders,
who are rapidly acquiring wealth and exalted notions, on the ground
that they were becoming unduly arrogant. The immediate cause of the
trouble was the fact that at a cockfight the M&#257;las&rsquo; birds
had defeated the Bagatas&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Bagatas, Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao writes that the
caste is divided into exogamous septs or intip&#275;rulu, some of which
occur also among the K&#257;pus, Telagas, and Vantaris. Girls are
married either before or after puberty, and the custom, called
m&#275;narikam, which renders it a man&rsquo;s duty to marry his
maternal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>uncle&rsquo;s daughter, is the general rule. An
Oriya or Telugu Br&#257;hman officiates at marriages, and the bride is
presented with jewelry as a substitute for the bride-price (v&#333;li)
in money. It is noted, in the Census Report, 1901, that, at a wedding,
the bridegroom is struck by his brother-in-law, who is then presented
with a pair of new cloths. The Bagatas are both Vaishnavites and
Saivites, and the former get themselves branded on the arm by a
Vaishnava guru, who lives in the God&#257;vari district. The
Vaishnavites burn their dead, and the Saivites bury them in the
customary sitting attitude. S&#257;t&#257;nis officiate for the former,
and Jangams for the latter. Both sections perform the chinna and pedda
r&#333;zu (big and little day) death ceremonies. The hill Bagatas
observe the Itiga Ponduga festival, which is celebrated by the hill
classes in Vizagapatam.</p>
<p><b>Bahus&#257;gara</b> (many seas).&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, as a synonym of Rang&#257;ri. The Rang&#257;ris
are tailors and dyers, and the signification of the name is not
clear.</p>
<p><b>Baidya.&mdash;</b><i>See</i> Vaidyan.</p>
<p><b>Bain&#275;du.&mdash;</b>The Bain&#275;du, or Bain&#275;di, as
they are called in the Census Report, 1901, are the musicians and
barbers of the M&#257;las and M&#257;digas. At the peddadinamu death
ceremony of the Gamallas, a M&#257;la Bain&#275;du takes part in the
recitation of the story of Ankamma, and in making the designs (muggu)
on the ground.</p>
<p><b>Bair&#257;gi.&mdash;</b>The Bair&#257;gis are a class of
religious mendicants, who roam about all over India, and are for the
most part recruited from North Indian castes. They are followers of
R&#257;m&#257;nand, who founded the order at the end of the fourteenth,
or beginning of the fifteenth century. According to common tradition,
the schism of R&#257;m&#257;nand originated in resentment of an affront
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>offered him by his fellow disciples, and
sanctioned by his teacher. It is said that he had spent some time in
travelling through various parts of India, after which he returned to
the math, or residence of his superior. His brethren objected to him
that in the course of his peregrinations it was impossible he could
have observed that privacy in his meals, which is a vital observance of
the R&#257;m&#257;nuja sect; and, as R&#257;ghav&#257;nand admitted the
validity of the objection, R&#257;m&#257;nand was condemned to feed in
a place apart from the rest of the disciples. He was highly incensed at
the order, and retired from the society altogether, establishing a
schism of his own.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9862src" href=
"#xd21e9862" name="xd21e9862src">19</a></p>
<p>The name Bair&#257;gi is derived from the Sanskrit vair&#257;gya (vi
+ r&#257;g), denoting without desire or passion, and indicates an
ascetic, who has subdued his passions, and liberated himself from
worldly desires. The Bair&#257;gis are sometimes called
B&#257;v&#257;ji or S&#257;dhu.</p>
<p>The Bair&#257;gis are Vaishnavites, and bear the Tengalai Vaishnava
mark (n&#257;mam), made with sandal-paste or g&#333;pi, on the
forehead. Bair&#257;gis with a Vadagalai mark are very rare. The
Bair&#257;gis wear necklaces of tulsi (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ocimum
sanctum</i>) beads or lotus (<i lang="la-x-bio">Nelumbium
speciosum</i>) seeds. Every Bair&#257;gi cooks his food within a space
cleansed with cow-dung water by himself or his disciple, and will not
leave the space until he has finished his meal. The Bair&#257;gis are
not particular about screening the space from the public gaze. They
partake of one meal daily, in the afternoon, and are abstainers from
flesh dietary. They live mainly on alms obtained in the bazars, or in
choultries (rest-houses for travellers). They generally carry with them
one or two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>brass vessels for cooking purposes, a
s&#257;lagr&#257;ma stone and a conch-shell for worship, and a chillum
(pipe) for smoking ganja (Indian hemp) or opium. They are, as a rule,
naked except for a small piece of cloth tied round the waist and passed
between the thighs. Some wear more elaborate body-clothing, and a
turban. They generally allow the beard to grow, and the hair of the
head is long and matted, with sometimes a long tail of yak or human
hair tied in a knot on the top of the head. Those who go about nearly
naked smear ashes all over their bodies. When engaged in begging, some
go through the streets, uttering aloud the name of some God. Others go
from house to house, or remain at a particular spot, where people are
expected to give them alms.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Bair&#257;gis.</p>
</div>
<p>Some Bair&#257;gis are celibates, and others married. They are
supposed to be celibates, but, as Dr. T. N. Bhattacharjee
observes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9885src" href="#xd21e9885" name=
"xd21e9885src">20</a> the &ldquo;monks of this order have generally a
large number of nuns attached to their convents, with whom they openly
live as man and wife.&rdquo; The Bair&#257;gis are very particular
about the worship of the s&#257;lagr&#257;ma stone, and will not
partake of food without worshipping it. When so doing, they cover their
head with a piece of cloth (R&#257;m n&#257;m ka safa), on which the
name R&#257;ma is printed in D&#275;van&#257;giri characters. Their
face and shoulders are stamped, by means of brass stamps, with the word
R&#257;ma in similar characters. For the purpose of meditation, the
Bair&#257;gi squats on the ground, sometimes with a deer or tiger skin
beneath him, and rests his hands on the cross-piece of his
y&#333;ga-dandam, or bent stick. A pair of tongs is stuck in the ground
on his right side, and sometimes fire is kept <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>near
it. It is noted by Mr. J. C. Oman<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9890src"
href="#xd21e9890" name="xd21e9890src">21</a> that &ldquo;a most
elaborate ritual has been laid down for the guidance of Bair&#257;gis
in the daily routine of the indispensable business and duties of life,
prescribing in minute detail how, for example, the ascetic should wash,
bathe, sit down, perform pranayam (stoppage or regulation of
respiration), purify his body, purge his mind, meditate on Vishnu,
repeat the G&#257;yatri (hymn) as composed for the special use of
members of the sect, worship R&#257;ma, Sita, Lakshman, Bharata, and
Satringah, together with R&#257;ma&rsquo;s bows and arrows, and,
lastly, the monkey god Hanum&#257;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bair&#257;gis have a guru or priest, whom they call Mahant. Some
visit the celebrated temple near Tirupati and pay their respects to the
Mahant thereof.</p>

Francis<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9942src" href="#xd21e9942" name=
"xd21e9942src">23</a> as being &ldquo;the chief Telugu trading caste,
scattered throughout all parts of the Presidency. It is said to have
two main sub-divisions, D&#275;sa (or K&#333;ta, a fort) and P&#275;ta
(street). The first of these includes those, whose ancestors are
supposed to have been the Balija (N&#257;yak) kings of Madura, Tanjore
and Vijayanagar, or provincial governors in those kingdoms; and to the
second belong those, like the G&#257;zulu (bangle sellers) and Perike
(salt-sellers), who live by trade. In the Tamil districts Balijas are
known as Vadugans (Telugu people) and Kavarais. The descendants of the
N&#257;yak or Balija Kings of Madura and Tanjore claim to be Kshatriyas
and of the K&#257;syapa (a rishi) g&#333;tra, while the Vijayanagar
R&#257;is say they are lineal descendants of the sage
Bh&#257;radw&#257;ja. Others trace their ancestry to the Kauravas of
the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata. This Kshatriya descent is, however, not
admitted by other castes, who say that Balijas are an offshoot of the
Kammas or K&#257;pus, or that they are a mixed community recruited from
these and other Telugu castes. The members of the caste none of them
now wear the sacred thread, or follow the V&#275;dic ritual. The name
Kart&#257;kkal (governors) was returned by those who claim to be
descendants of the N&#257;yak Kings of Madura and Tanjore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a letter submitted, from Coimbatore, to Mr. Francis in connection
with the census, 1901, it was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135"
href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>stated that &ldquo;the Balija
people are Kshatriyas of the Lunar Race, as can be proved by a
reference to the Bahgavatham, Vishnupur&#257;nam, and
Brahmmandapur&#257;nam, etc.... In this connection, it will be
interesting to note that one Sevappa Naidu married Murthiammal,
sister-in-law to Achuta D&#275;va Rayulu of Narapathi Samasthanam of
Vijayanagar, and as a marriage portion or dowry received the territory
of Tanjore, over which he ruled as king for a long period. It was at
this time that the celebrated Tirumalay Naidu of Madura took as wife
one of the daughters of Sevappa Naidu&rsquo;s family. Tirumalay&rsquo;s
grandson, one Chockalinga Naidu, married Mangammal, daughter of
Vijiaragavulu Naidu, a grandson of the said Tanjore Sevappa Naidu. It
will thus be seen that the Naidu rulers of Tanjore, Trichinopoly, and
Madura, were all relations of Narapathi Samasthanam of Vijianagar. That
these Narapathies of Vijianagaram were Kshatriyas of the Lunar Race can
be clearly seen by a reference to Manucharithra,
P&#257;rij&#257;th&#257;paharanam, Prouda Prabanda Kavi Charitra, etc.,
and that they were direct descendants of the great Andra Kings can be
proved with equal satisfaction by referring to Colonel
Mackenzie&rsquo;s MSS., in the introduction of A. D. Campbell&rsquo;s
Telugu Grammar, and James Prinsep&rsquo;s Useful Tables of Andra Kings
will show that the Andras were immediate descendants of the well-known
Yayathi R&#257;ja of the Lunar Race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Balijas,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e9951src" href="#xd21e9951" name=
"xd21e9951src">24</a> &ldquo;are the trading caste of the Telugu
country, but they are now found in every part of the Presidency.
Concerning the origin of this caste several traditions exist, but the
most probable is that which represents them as a recent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>offshoot of the K&#257;pu or Reddi caste. The
caste is rather a mixed one, for they will admit, without much scruple,
persons who have been expelled from their proper caste, or who are the
result of irregular unions. The bulk of the Balijas are now engaged in
cultivation, and this accounts for so many having returned K&#257;pu as
their main caste, for K&#257;pu is also a common Telugu word used for a
ryot (farmer). It is not improbable that there was once a closer
connection than now between the K&#257;pus and the Balijas, and the
claim of the Balijas to belong to the K&#257;pu caste may have a
foundation in fact. In their customs there is very little difference
between the K&#257;pus and Balijas. Their girls are married both before
and after puberty. The re-marriage of widows is forbidden. They eat
flesh, and alcohol is said to be freely indulged in [There is a proverb
&lsquo;If a man be born a Balija, he must crack the arrack
bottle&rsquo;]. Like the B&#333;gams and S&#257;nis, the Balija females
usually wear a petticoat instead of the long robe of ordinary Hindus.
The general name of the caste is Naidu.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Balija
Naidu,&rdquo; it has been said,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9956src"
href="#xd21e9956" name="xd21e9956src">25</a> &ldquo;is to be met with
in almost every walk of life&mdash;railway station-masters, head
coolies, bakers, butlers, municipal inspectors, tappal (post) runners,
hawkers, and hotel-keepers. The title Chetti is by some used in
preference to Naidu.&rdquo; It is noted in the Bellary Manual that the
Balijas &ldquo;have by common consent obtained a high place in the
social system of South India. Some are land-owners, residing on and
working their own property with the help of members of inferior castes;
but the majority live by trade.&rdquo; At Tirupati, a number of Balija
families are engaged in the red sanders wood (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Pterocarpus santalinus</i>), carving <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>industry. Figures of sw&#257;mis (deities),
mythological figures, elephants, and miniature temple cars with flying
cherubs and winged horses, are most abundantly carved: but domestic
utensils in the shape of chembus, kinnis, cups, plates, etc., are
turned on the lathe. Large vessels are sometimes made of the wood of
v&#275;pi or &#257;chamaram (<i lang="la-x-bio">Hardwickia binata</i>),
which resembles red sanders wood, but is more liable to crack. The
carved figures are sold to pilgrims and others who visit Tirupati, and
are also taken to Conjeeveram, Madura, and other places, at times when
important temple festivals are celebrated. Vessels made of red sanders
wood carry no pollution, and can be used by women during the menstrual
period, and taken back to the house without any purification ceremony.
For the same reason, Sany&#257;sis (ascetics) use such vessels for
doing p&#363;ja.</p>
<p>The name Balija is said to be derived from the Sanskrit bali (a
sacrifice) and ja (born), signifying that the Balijas owe their origin
to the performance of a y&#257;gam. The legend is current that on one
occasion Siva wanted his consort Parvati to appear before him in all
her glory. But, when she stood before him, fully decorated, he laughed,
and said that she was not as charming as she might be. On this, she
prayed that Siva would help her to become so. From his braid of hair
Siva created a being who descended on the earth, bearing a number of
bangles and turmeric paste, with which Parvati adorned herself. Siva,
being greatly pleased with her appearance, told her to look at herself
in a looking-glass. The being, who brought the bangles, is believed to
have been the ancestor of the G&#257;zula Balijas. According to another
version of the legend, Parvati was not satisfied with her appearance
when she saw herself in the looking-glass, and asked her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>father to tell her how she was to make herself
more attractive. He accordingly prayed to Brahma, who ordered him to
perform a severe penance (thapas). From the sacrificial fire, kindled
in connection therewith, arose a being leading a donkey laden with
heaps of bangles, turmeric, palm leaf rolls for the ears, black beads,
sandal powder, a comb, perfumes, etc. From this Maha Purusha who thus
sprang from a sacrifice (bali), the Balijas derived their origin and
name. To him, in token of respect, were given flags, torches, and
certain musical instruments.</p>
<p>The D&#275;s&#257;yis, or leaders of the right-hand faction, are
said to be Balijas by caste. In former days they had very great
influences, and all castes belonging to the right-hand faction would
obey the D&#275;s&#257;yi Chetti. Even at the present day, the
Odd&#275;s and others refer their disputes to the D&#275;s&#257;yi, and
not to their own caste headman. In former times there were three
principal D&#275;s&#257;yis, who had their head-quarters at
Conjeeveram, Cuddalore, and Walajapet. The head D&#275;s&#257;yi
possesses a biruthu (insigne of office) in the form of a large brass
ladle with a bell attached to it. On the occasion of Balija marriages
and funerals, this is sent through the Chalavathi (a pariah), who is
the servant of the D&#275;s&#257;yi, and has the right of allu
eduththal (taking a handful) when he goes to the bazaar, where he
receives meat from the butcher, vegetables, etc., as his perquisite.
The D&#275;s&#257;yi&rsquo;s ladle is kept in the custody of the
Chalavathi (<i>See</i> D&#275;s&#257;yi).</p>

<p>The Balijas, Mr. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e9984src"
href="#xd21e9984" name="xd21e9984src">26</a> &ldquo;employ
Br&#257;hmans and S&#257;t&#257;nis as their priests. The chief object
of their worship is Gauri, their caste deity. It is said that the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>M&#257;las are the hereditary custodians of the
idol of Gauri and her jewels, which the Balijas get from them whenever
they want to worship her. The following story is told to account for
this. The K&#257;pus and Balijas, molested by the Muhammadan invaders
on the north of the northern Penn&#257;r, migrated to the south when
the Penn&#257;r was in full flood. Being unable to cross the river,
they invoked their deity to make a passage for them, for which it
demanded the sacrifice of a first-born child. While they stood at a
loss what to do, the M&#257;las who followed them boldly offered one of
their children to the goddess. Immediately the river divided before
them, and the K&#257;pus and the Balijas crossed it, and were saved
from the tyranny of the Muhammadans. Ever since that time, the
M&#257;las have been respected by the K&#257;pus and Balijas, and the
latter even deposited the images of Gauri, the bull and Gan&#275;sa,
which they worshipped, in the house of a M&#257;la. I am credibly
informed that the practice of leaving these images in the custody of
M&#257;las is even now observed in some parts of the Cuddapah district
and elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the numerous sub-divisions of the Balijas, the following may be
noticed:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">G&#257;zula, glass bangles. Valaiyal or vala (bangle)
Chetti is the Tamil equivalent. By some the sight of a G&#257;zula
Balija with his pile of bangles on his back is considered a good omen.
In recent years, a scare has arisen in connection with an insect, which
is said to take up its abode in imported German glass bangles, which
compete with the indigenous industry of the G&#257;zulas. The insect is
believed to lie low in the bangle till it is purchased, when it comes
out and nips the wearer, after warning her to get her affairs in order
before succumbing. A specimen of a broken bangle, from which the insect
is stated to have burst forth and stung a girl in the wrist, was sent
to me. But the insect was not forthcoming. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>Gandavallu, or Gundapodi v&#257;ndlu. Go about the villages, hawking
turmeric, kunkumam (colour powder), kamela (<i lang="la-x-bio">Mallotus
philippinensis</i>) dye powder, beads, combs, cosmetics and other
articles. Supposed to have been originally K&#333;matis.</p>
<p>Kavarai, Tamil synonym for Balija.</p>
<p>Linga.</p>
<p>Panchama.</p>
<p>Telugu or Telaga. A synonym for Balija in the Northern Circars.</p>
<p>R&#257;jam&#257;hendram or M&#363;su Kamma. The former denotes the
town of Rajahmundry, and the latter a special ear-ornament worn by
women.</p>
<p>T&#333;ta, garden.</p>
<p>Ralla, precious stones.</p>
<p>Pagadala, coral.</p>
<p>P&#363;sa, beads.</p>
<p>R&#257;cha, royal.</p>
<p>Vy&#257;sa. A sage (rishi) or hunter, whom the hunting classes claim
as their ancestor.</p>
</div>
<p>Other sub-divisions, classified as Balijas at the census, 1901,
were:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Jakkulas, among whom it was, at Tenali in the Kistna
district, formerly customary for each family to give up one girl for
prostitution. Under the influence of social reform, a written agreement
was a few years ago entered into to give up the practice.</p>
<p>&#256;dap&#257;pa. Female attendants on the ladies of the families
of Zamindars, who, as they are not allowed to marry, lead a life of
prostitution. Their sons call themselves Balijas. In some places,
<i>e.g.</i>, the Kistna and God&#257;vari districts, this class is
known as Khasa or Khasavandlu.</p>
<p>Santa Kavarai. Returned as Balijas in the Chingleput district.</p>
<p>Ravut. Returned in the Salem district. Said to have been formerly
soldiers under the Poligars.</p>
</div>
<p>Like other Telugu castes, the Balijas have exogamous septs
(intip&#275;ru) and g&#333;tras. Of the former, the following are
examples:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is a saying that a Balija who has no g&#333;tra must take the
name of the Pasuleti, or Pasupuleti g&#333;tra. In like manner, a
Br&#257;hman orphan, whose g&#333;tra cannot be traced, is made to
adopt the Vathsa g&#333;tra.</p>
<p>Among the M&#363;su Kammas, the consent of both the maternal uncle
and elder sister&rsquo;s husband must be obtained before a girl is
given in marriage. At the betrothal ceremony, the future
bridegroom&rsquo;s relations proceed to the house of the girl, carrying
the following articles on an odd number of trays beneath a cloth canopy
(ulladam): mustard, fenugreek (<i lang="la-x-bio">Trigonella
F&oelig;numgr&aelig;cum</i>), cummin seeds, curds, jaggery, dh&#257;l
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Cajanus indicus</i>), balls of condiments,
tamarinds, pepper, twenty-one cakes, eleven cocoanuts, salt, plantains,
flowers, a new cloth, black beads, a palm-leaf roll for the ear lobe,
turmeric, a comb, and kunkumam (colour powder). A few rupees, called
kongu mudi, to be given to the future mother-in-law, are also placed on
the tray. The contracting parties exchange betel and a cocoanut, of
which the latter is taken away by a member of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
party, tied up in his body-cloth. The girl is seated on a plank, goes
through the ceremony (nalagu) of being anointed with oil and paste, and
is presented with a new cloth. Wearing this, she sits on the plank, and
betel, flowers, jewels, etc., are placed in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>her
lap. A near female relation then ties a string of black beads round her
neck. Among the M&#363;su Kammas, the milk-post, consisting of a green
bamboo, with sometimes a branch of <i lang="la-x-bio">Odina Wodier</i>,
must be set up two days before the commencement of the marriage
ceremonies. It is worshipped, and to it are tied an iron ring, and a
string of cotton and wool twisted together (kankanam). A small
framework, called dhornam, made of two sticks, across which cotton
threads or pieces of cloth are stretched, is brought by a washerwoman,
and given to the maternal uncle of the bridegroom, who ties it to the
marriage booth. The marriage pots are brought from a potter&rsquo;s
house beneath a cloth canopy (ulladam), and given to married couples,
closely related to the bridegroom, who fetch water, and place the pots
on the dais. Some married women pour rice on a clean white cloth spread
on the floor, and rub off the bran with their hands, while they sing
songs. The cloth to be worn by the bridegroom is dipped in turmeric
water by these women and dried. The Balijas are very particular about
the worship of their female ancestors (p&#275;rant&#257;lu) and no
auspicious ceremony can be commenced until p&#275;rant&#257;lu
p&#363;ja has been performed. Among the M&#363;su Kammas, five women,
who are closely related to the bridal couple, take only one meal a day,
and try to keep free from pollution of all sorts. They go through the
nalagu ceremony, and are presented with new cloths. Among other
sections, the wall is simply painted with turmeric dots to represent
the ancestors. The ancestor worship concluded, the finger and toe-nails
of the bridegroom are cut, and a M&#363;su Kamma bridegroom is
conducted to a temple of Vign&#275;swara (Gan&#275;sa), if there is one
near at hand. By other sections it is considered sufficient, if
Vign&#275;swara worship is performed at the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>marriage booth. The M&#363;su Kamma bridegroom
is dressed up at the temple, and a bashingam (chaplet) tied on his
forehead. An old-fashioned turban (p&#257;ghai) is placed on his head,
and a dagger (jimthadu) stuck into his waist-cloth. It is said that, in
olden times, the Balijas used to worship the dagger, and sacrifice
sheep or goats at marriages. The bridegroom is next brought to the
house where the wedding is being celebrated, and his brother-in-law
washes his feet, and, after throwing flowers and rice over them, puts
toe-rings and shoes thereon. The Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit lights the
sacred fire (h&#333;mam), and pours gh&#299; (clarified butter)
therein, while he utters some verses, V&#275;dic or other. He then ties
the kankanam (thread) on the bridegroom&rsquo;s wrist. The parents of
the bride next proceed with the dh&#257;r&#257;dhattam (gift of the
girl) by pouring water and grains of rice into the hands of the
bridegroom. Vign&#275;swara is then worshipped, and the bottu (marriage
badge) is blessed by those assembled, and handed to the bridegroom. He,
placing his right foot on that of the bride, who is separated from him
by a screen, ties it round her neck. The couple then exchange seats,
and rice is thrown in front of them. They next go thrice round the dais
and milk-post, and, at the end of the first and second rounds, the foot
of the bride is placed on a grinding stone. After the third round they
gaze at the pole-star (Arundati). Into one of the marriage pots are put
a pap-bowl, ring, and bracelet, which are picked out by the couple. If
the pap-bowl is first got hold of by the bridegroom, the first-born
child will be a boy; if the ring, it will be a girl. This rite
concluded, the bridegroom makes a mark on the bride&rsquo;s forehead
with collyrium. On the second day, the bridegroom makes a pretence of
being angry, and stays in a garden or house near that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>in
which the marriage ceremonies are conducted. The bride, and some of her
relations, go to him in procession, and, treating him with great
respect, bring him back. The sacred fire is lighted, and the bride
enters the room in which the marriage pots (arav&#275;ni) are kept. The
bridegroom is stopped at the entrance thereto by a number of married
women, and has to call his wife by her name, and pay a small sum of
money for the &#257;rathi (coloured water), which is waved by the
women, to ward off the evil eye. In some places, the sister of the
bridegroom extracts a promise that his coral (daughter) shall be given
in marriage to her pearl (son). He is then permitted to enter the room.
On the third day, after h&#333;mam has been performed by the
Br&#257;hman priest, the newly married couple go through a burlesque
imitation of domestic life, after they have worshipped the posts of the
booth, and perform a mimic ploughing ceremony, the bridegroom stirring
up some earth in a basket with a stick or miniature plough. This, in
some places, his sister tries to prevent him from doing by covering the
basket with a cloth, and he has to say &ldquo;I will give my coral to
your pearl.&rdquo; His brother-in-law tries to squeeze his fingers
between a pair of sticks called kitti, which was, in former times, a
very popular form of torture as a means of extracting confession. The
bride gives her husband some conji (rice-gruel) to refresh him after
his pretended labour.</p>
<p>At a marriage among the Perikes (<i>q.v.</i>), a gunny-bag is said
to be worshipped before the bottu is tied. A quantity of rice is
measured on the first day of the ceremonies and tied up in a cloth. On
the third day, the cloth is opened, and it is considered an auspicious
sign if the quantity of rice exceeds that which was originally put into
it. Among the R&#257;jam&#257;hendram <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>Balijas, just before
the nalagu ceremony, the knees, shoulders, and cheeks of the bride and
bridegroom are touched with a pestle, while the names of their septs
are called out. On the third day, the same process is repeated, but in
the reverse order. A G&#257;zula Balija bride must, when the bottu is
tied, be dressed in a white cloth with red stripes, called sanna
pappuli. With other sections, a white cloth dyed with turmeric is <i>de
rigeur</i>.</p>
<p>Balija, it may be noted, is, in the North Arcot Manual, returned as
a division of D&#257;saris and &#298;digas. The better classes of
M&#275;daras (cane-splitters and mat-makers) are also taking to calling
themselves Balijas, and assume the title Chetti. Odd&#275;s and Upparas
sometimes style themselves Odd&#275; Balija and Uppara Balija. They
belong to the right-hand section, which is headed by the D&#275;sayi,
who is a Balija, and so describe themselves as belonging to the Setti
or Chetti samayam (section). Some members of the Mila and V&#257;da
fishing castes have adopted &#332;da or V&#257;da (boat) Balija as
their caste name.</p>
<p><b>Ball&#257;la.&mdash;</b>Ball&#257;la, or Bell&#257;la, was

Canarese form of the Malay&#257;lam Velutt&#275;dan or
Vannatt&#257;n.</p>
<p><b>Banni or Vanni</b> (<i lang="la-x-bio">Prosopis
spicigera</i>).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kuruba and Kurni. The tree
is worshipped because on it &ldquo;the five P&#257;ndava princes hung
up their arms when they entered Vir&#257;t Nagra in disguise. On the
tree the arms turned to snakes, and remained untouched till the owners
returned.&rdquo; (<i>Lisboa.</i>)</p>
<p><b>Bant.&mdash;</b>For the following account of the Bants I am
mainly indebted to Mr. H. A. Stuart&rsquo;s description of them in the
Manual of South Canara. The name Bant, pronounced Bunt, means in Tulu a
powerful man or soldier, and indicates that the Bants were originally a
military class corresponding to the N&#257;yars of Malabar. The term
N&#257;dava instead of Bant in the northern portions of South Canara
points, among other indications, to a territorial organisation by
n&#257;ds similar to that described <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>by Mr. Logan as
prevailing in Malabar. &ldquo;The N&#257;yars,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;were, until the British occupied the country, the militia of the
district. Originally they seem to have been organised into &lsquo;Six
Hundreds,&rsquo; and each six hundred seems to have had assigned to it
the protection of all the people in a n&#257;d or country. The n&#257;d
was in turn split up into taras, a Dravidian word signifying originally
a foundation, the foundation of a house, hence applied collectively to
a street, as in Tamil teru, in Telugu teruvu, and in Canarese and Tulu
ter&#257;vu. The tara was the N&#257;yar territorial unit for civil
purposes.&rdquo; It has been stated that &ldquo;the Malabar Nair
chieftain of old had his n&#257;d or barony, and his own military
class; and the relics of this powerful feudal system still survive in
the names of some of the t&#257;luks (divisions) of modern Malabar, and
in the official designations of certain Nair families, whose men still
come out with quaint-looking swords and shields to guard the person of
the Zamorin on the occasion of the rice-throwing ceremony, which
formally constitutes him the ruler of the land. Correspondingly, the
Bants of the northern parts of Canara still answer to the territorial
name of N&#257;d Bants, or warriors of the n&#257;d or territory. It is
necessary to explain that, in both ancient K&#275;ralam and Tulu, the
functions of the great military and dominant classes were so
distributed that only certain classes were bound to render military
service to the ruling prince. The rest were lairds or squires, or
gentleman farmers, or the labourers and artisans of their particular
community, though all of them cultivated a love of manly
sports.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10224src" href="#xd21e10224"
name="xd21e10224src">29</a></p>
<p>Few traces of any such organisation as has been indicated now
prevail, great changes having been made <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>when the Vijayanagar
Government introduced, more than five hundred years ago, a system of
administration under which the local Jain chiefs, though owing
allegiance to an overlord, became more independent in their relations
with the people of the country. Under the Bedn&#363;r kings, and still
more under the Mysore rule, the power of the chiefs was also swept
away, but the old organisation was not reverted to.</p>
<p>The Bants are now the chief land-owning and cultivating class in
South Canara, and are, with the exception of the Billavas or
toddy-drawers, the most numerous caste in the district. &ldquo;At the
present day, the Bants of Canara are largely the independent and
influential landed gentry, some would say, perhaps, the substantial
yeomanry. They still retain their manly independence of character,
their strong and well developed physique, and they still carry their
heads with the same haughty toss as their forefathers did in the
stirring fighting days when, as an old proverb had it, &lsquo;The slain
rested in the yard of the slayer,&rsquo; and when every warrior
constantly carried his sword and shield. Both men and women of the Bant
community are among the comeliest of Asiatic races, the men having high
foreheads and well-turned aquiline noses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the agricultural economy of South Canara, Rao Sahib T.
Raghaviah writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10235src" href=
"#xd21e10235" name="xd21e10235src">30</a> that &ldquo;the ryot
(cultivator) of South Canara loves to make his land look attractive,
and every field is lined with the lovely areca, and the stately palm.
The slopes adjoining the rich fields are studded with plantations of
jack, mango, cashew, plantain and other fruit and shade trees, and the
ryot would not even omit to daub his trees with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>alternate white and red bands, with which the
east coast women love to adorn a marriage house or temple wall. These,
with the regularly laid out and carefully embanked water-courses and
streams, lend an air of enchantment to the whole scene. The ignorance
prevailing among the women of the richer section of the landed classes
(on the east coast) is so great that it is not uncommon to ridicule a
woman by saying that what she knows about paddy (rice) is that it grows
on a tree. But, in a district like South Canara, the woman that does
not know agriculture is the exception. I have often come across
respectable women of the landed classes like the Bants, Shivallis, and
Nairs, managing large landed estates as efficiently as men. The South
Canara woman is born on the land, and lives on it. She knows when to
sow, and when to reap; how much seed to sow, and how much labour to
employ to plough, to weed, or to reap. She knows how to prepare her
seed, and to cure her tobacco, to garner her grain, and to preserve her
cucumbers through the coming monsoon. She knows further how to feed her
cow, and to milk it, to treat it when sick, and to graze it when hale.
She also knows how to make her manure, and how to use it without
wasting a bit of it. She knows how to collect green leaves for her
manure, and to help the fuel reserve on the hill slope above her house
grow by a system of lopping the branches and leaving the standards. She
knows also how to collect her areca nuts, and to prepare them for the
market, and to collect her cocoanuts, and haggle for a high price for
them with her customers. There is, in fact, not a single thing about
agriculture which the South Canara man knows, and which the South
Canara woman does not know. It is a common sight, as one passes through
a paddy flat or along the adjoining slope, to see housewives bringing
out handfuls <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>of ashes collected in the oven over night, and
depositing them at the root of the nearest fruit tree on their
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of the Bants are Hindus by religion, and rank as S&#363;dras,
but about ten thousand of them are Jains. Probably they originally
assumed Jainism as a fashionable addition to the ancestral demon
worship, to which they all still adhere, whether they profess to be
Vaishnavites, Saivites, or Jains. It is probable that, during the
political supremacy of the Jains, a much larger proportion of the Bants
professed adherence to that religion than now-a-days.</p>
<p>There are four principal sub-divisions of the caste, viz.,
M&#257;s&#257;dika, who are the ordinary Bants of Tuluva; N&#257;dava
or N&#257;d, who speak Canarese, and are found in the northern part of
South Canara; the Pariv&#257;ra, who do not follow the aliya
sant&#257;na system of inheritance; and the Jains. Members of these
sub-divisions may not intermarry, but instances have occurred of
marriage between members of the M&#257;s&#257;dika and N&#257;d
sub-divisions.</p>
<p>Nothing very definite is known of the origin of the Bants, but
Tuluva seems, in the early centuries of the Christian era, to have had
kings who apparently were sometimes independent and sometimes
feudatories of overlords, such as the Pallavas, the early Kadambas, the
early Ch&#257;lukyans, the later Kadambas, the western Ch&#257;lukyans,
the Kalachurians, and the Hoysal Ball&#257;ls. This indicates a
constant state of fighting, which would account for an important class
of the population being known as Bantaru or warriors; and, as a matter
of course, they succeeded in becoming the owners of all the land which
did not fall to the share of the priestly class, the Br&#257;hmans.
Ancient inscriptions speak of kings of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>Tuluva, and the
Bairasu Wodears of K&#257;rakal, whose inscriptions have been found at
Kalasa as early as the twelfth century, may have exercised power
throughout Tuluva or the greater part of it. But, when the Vijayanagar
dynasty became the overlords of Canara in 1336, there were then
existing a number of minor chiefs who had probably been in power long
before, and the numerous titles still remaining among the Bants and
Jains, and the local dignities known as Pattam and Gadi, point to the
existence from very early times of a number of more or less powerful
local chieftains. The system peculiar to the west coast under which all
property vests in females, and is managed by the seniors of the family,
was also favourable to the continuance of large landed properties, and
it is probable that it is only within comparatively recent times that
sub-division of landed property became anything like as common as it is
now. All the Bants, except the Pariv&#257;ra and a few Jains follow
this aliya sant&#257;na system of inheritance,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10250src" href="#xd21e10250" name="xd21e10250src">31</a> a
survival of a time when the military followers of conquering invaders
or local chiefs married women of the local land-owning classes, and the
most important male members of the family were usually absent in camp
or at court, while the women remained at the family house on the
estate, and managed the farms. The titles and the pattams or dignities
have always been held by the male members, but, as they also go with
the landed property, they necessarily devolve on the sister&rsquo;s son
of a deceased holder, whence has arisen the name aliya sant&#257;na,
which means sister&rsquo;s son lineage. A story is embodied in local
traditions, attributing the origin of the system to the fiat of a king
named Bh&#363;tal P&#257;ndya, until whose time makkala sant&#257;na,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>or inheritance from father to son, generally
obtained. &ldquo;It is said that the maternal uncle of this prince,
called D&#275;va P&#257;ndya, wanted to launch his newly constructed
ships with valuable cargo in them, when Kundodara, king of demons
demanded a human sacrifice. D&#275;va P&#257;ndya asked his
wife&rsquo;s permission to offer one of his sons, but she refused,
while his sister Satyavati offered her son Jaya P&#257;ndya for the
purpose. Kundodara, discovering in the child signs of future greatness,
waived the sacrifice, and permitted the ships to sail. He then took the
child, restored to him his father&rsquo;s kingdom of Jayantika, and
gave him the name of Bh&#363;tal P&#257;ndya. Subsequently, when some
of the ships brought immense wealth, the demon again appeared, and
demanded of D&#275;va P&#257;ndya another human sacrifice. On the
latter again consulting his wife, she refused to comply with the
request, and publicly renounced her title and that of her children to
the valuable property brought in the ships. Kundodara then demanded the
D&#275;va P&#257;ndya to disinherit his sons of the wealth which had
been brought in the ships, as also of the kingdom, and to bestow all on
his sister&rsquo;s son, Jaya or Bh&#363;tal P&#257;ndya. This was
accordingly done. And, as this prince inherited his kingdom from his
maternal uncle and not from his father, he ruled that his own example
should be followed by his subjects, and it was thus that the aliya
sant&#257;na law was established about A.D. 77.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10257src" href="#xd21e10257" name=
"xd21e10257src">32</a></p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. L. Moore<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10262src"
href="#xd21e10262" name="xd21e10262src">33</a> that various judicial
decisions relating to the aliya sant&#257;na system are based to a
great extent on a book termed Aliya Santanada Kattu Kattale, which was
alleged to be the work of Bhutala P&#257;ndiya, who, according to Dr.
Whitley Stokes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154"
name="pb154">154</a>]</span>the learned scholar who edited the first
volume of the Madras High Court Reports, lived about A.D. 78, but which
is in reality a very recent forgery compiled about 1840. As to this,
Dr. A. C. Burnell observes as follows in a note in his law of partition
and succession. &ldquo;One patent imposture yet accepted by the Courts
as evidence is the Aliya Santanada Kattu Kattale, a falsified account
of the customs of South Canara. Silly as many Indian books are, a more
childish or foolish tract it would be impossible to discover; it is
about as much worthy of notice in a law court as &lsquo;Jack the Giant
Killer.&rsquo; That it is a recent forgery is certain.... The origin of
the book in its present state is well-known; it is satisfactorily
traced to two notorious forgers and scoundrels about thirty years ago,
and all copies have been made from the one they produced. I have
enquired in vain for an old manuscript, and am informed, on the best
authority, that not one exists. A number of recent manuscripts are to
be found, but they all differ essentially one from another. A more
clumsy imposture it would be hard to find, but it has proved a
mischievous one in South Canara, and threatens to render a large amount
of property quite valueless. The forgers knew the people they had to
deal with, the Bants, and, by inserting a course that families which
did not follow the Aliya Sant&#257;na shall become extinct, have
effectually prevented an application for legislative interference,
though the poor superstitious folk would willingly (it is said) have
the custom abolished.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10267src" href=
"#xd21e10267" name="xd21e10267src">34</a></p>
<p>As a custom similar to aliya sant&#257;na prevails in Malabar, it no
doubt originated before Tuluva and K&#275;rala <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>were
separated. The small body of Pariv&#257;ra Bants, and the few Jain
Bants that do not follow the aliya sant&#257;na system, are probably
the descendants of a few families who allowed their religious
conversion to Hinduism or Jainism to have more effect on their social
relations than was commonly the case. Now that the ideas regarding
marriage among the Bants are in practice assimilated to a great extent
to those of most other people, the national rule of inheritance is a
cause of much heart-burning and quarrelling, fathers always
endeavouring to benefit their own offspring at the cost of the estate.
A change would be gladly welcomed by many, but vested interests in
property constitute an almost insuperable obstacle.</p>
<p>The Bants do not usually object to the use of animal food, except,
of course, the flesh of the cow, and they do not as a rule wear the
sacred thread. But there are some families of position called
Ball&#257;ls, amongst whom heads of families abstain from animal food,
and wear the sacred thread. These neither eat nor intermarry with the
ordinary Bants. The origin of the Ball&#257;ls is explained by a
proverb, which says that when a Bant becomes powerful, he becomes a
Ball&#257;l. Those who have the dignity called Pattam, and the heads of
certain families, known as Shettivalas or Heggades, also wear the
sacred thread, and are usually managers or mukhtesars of the temples
and bh&#363;tasth&#257;ns or demon shrines within the area over which,
in former days, they are said to have exercised a more extended
jurisdiction, dealing not only with caste disputes, but settling
numerous civil and criminal matters. The Jain Bants are strict
vegetarians, and they abstain from the use of alcoholic liquors, the
consumption of which is permitted among other Bants, though the
practice is not common. The Jain Bants avoid taking food after sunset.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>The more well-to-do Bants usually occupy substantial houses on their
estates, in many of which there is much fine wood-work, and, in some
cases, the pillars of the porches and verandahs, and the doorways are
artistically and elaborately carved. These houses have been described
as being well built, thatched with palm, and generally prettily
situated with beautiful scenic prospects stretching away on all
sides.</p>
<p>The Bants have not as a rule largely availed themselves of European
education, and consequently there are but few of them in the Government
service, but among these few some have attained to high office, and
been much respected. As is often the case among high spirited people of
primitive modes of thought, party and faction feeling run high, and
jealousy and disputes about landed property often lead to hasty acts of
violence. Now-a-days, however, the last class of disputes more
frequently lead to protracted litigation in the Courts.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Kambla Buffalo Race.</p>
</div>
<p>The Bants are fond of out-door sports, football and buffalo-racing
being amongst their favourite amusements. But the most popular of all
is cock-fighting. Every Bant, who is not a Jain, takes an interest in
this sport, and large assemblages of cocks are found at every fair and
festival throughout South Canara. &ldquo;The outsider,&rdquo; it has
been said,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10289src" href="#xd21e10289"
name="xd21e10289src">35</a> &ldquo;cannot fail to be struck with the
tremendous excitement that attends a village fair in South Canara.
Large numbers of cocks are displayed for sale, and groups of excited
people may be seen huddled together, bending down with intense
eagerness to watch every detail in the progress of a combat between two
celebrated village game-cocks.&rdquo; Cock fights on an elaborate scale
take place on the day after the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157"
href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>D&#299;p&#257;vali,
Sankaranthi or Vinayakachathurthi, and Gokal&#257;shtami festivals,
outside the village boundary. At Hiriadaka, in October, 1907, more than
a hundred birds were tethered by the leg to the scrub jungle composed
of the evergreen shrub <i lang="la-x-bio">Ixora coccinea</i>, or
carried in the arms of their owners or youngsters. Only males, from the
town and surrounding villages, were witnesses of the spectacle. The
tethered birds, if within range of each other, excited by the constant
crowing and turmoil, indulged in an impromptu fight. Grains of rice and
water were poured into the mouths and over the heads of the birds
before the fight, and after each round. The birds were armed with
cunningly devised steel spurs, constituting a battery of variously
curved and sinuous weapons. It is believed that the Bh&#363;ta (demon)
is appeased, if the blood from the wounds drops on the ground. The men,
whose duty it is to separate the birds at the end of a round, sometimes
receive nasty wounds from the spurs. The tail feathers of a wounded
bird are lifted up, and a palm leaf fan or towel is waved to and fro
over the cloacal orifice to revive it. The owner of a victorious bird
becomes the possessor of the vanquished bird, dead or alive. At an
exhibition of the products of South Canara, during a recent visit of
the Governor of Madras to Mangalore, a collection of spurs was
exhibited in the class &ldquo;household implements.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="figureHead">Kambla Racing Buffaloes.</p>
</div>
<p>For the following note on buffalo races, I am indebted to Mr. H. O.
D. Harding. &ldquo;This is a sport that has grown up among a race of
cultivators of wet land. It is, I believe, peculiar to South Canara,
where all the cultivation worth mentioning is wet. The Bants and Jains,
and other landowners of position, own and run buffaloes, and the
Billava, or toddy drawer, has also entered the racing world. Every rich
Bant keeps his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>kambla field consecrated to buffalo-racing, and
his pair of racing buffaloes, costing from Rs. 150 to Rs. 500, are
splendid animals; and, except for an occasional plough-drawing at the
beginning of the cultivation season, are used for no purpose all the
year, except racing. The racing is for no prize or stakes, and there is
no betting, starter, judge, or winning post. Each pair of buffaloes
runs the course alone, and is judged by the assembled crowd for pace
and style, and, most important of all, the height and breadth of the
splash which they make. Most people know the common levelling plank
used by the ryots (cultivators) all over India to level the wet field
after ploughing. It is a plank some 4 or 5 feet long by 1 or 1&frac12;
feet broad, and on it the driver stands to give it weight, and the
buffaloes pull it over the mud of a flooded rice-field. This is the
prototype of the buffalo-racing car, and any day during the cultivating
season in the Tulu country one may see two boys racing for the love of
the sport, as they drive their levelling boards. From this the racing
car has been specialised, and, if a work of art for its own purpose, is
not a car on which any one could or would wish to travel far. The
leveller of utility is cut down to a plank about 1&frac12; by 1 foot,
sometimes handsomely carved, on which is fixed a gaily decorated wooden
stool about 6 inches high and 10 inches across each way, hollowed out
on the top, and just big enough to afford good standing for one foot.
In the plank, on each side, are holes to let the mud and water through.
The plank is fixed to a pole, which is tied to the buffalo&rsquo;s
yoke. The buffaloes are decorated with coloured jh&#363;ls and
marvellous head-pieces of brass and silver (sometimes bearing the
emblems of the sun and moon), and ropes which make a sort of bridle.
The driver, stripping himself to the necessary minimum of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>garments, mounts, while some of his friends
cling, like ants struggling round a dead beetle, to the buffaloes. When
he is fairly up, they let go, and the animals start. The course is a
wet rice-field, about 150 yards long, full of mud and water. All round
are hundreds, or perhaps thousands of people, including Pariahs who
dance in groups in the mud, play stick-game, and beat drums. In front
of the galloping buffaloes the water is clear and still, throwing a
powerful reflection of them as they gallop down the course, raising a
perfect tornado of mud and water. The driver stands with one foot on
the stool, and one on the pole of the car. He holds a whip aloft in one
hand, and one of the buffaloes&rsquo; tails in the other. He drives
without reins, with nothing but a waggling tail to hold on to and steer
by. Opening his mouth wide, he shouts for all he is worth, while, to
all appearances, a deluge of mud and water goes down his throat. So he
comes down the course, the plank on which he stands throwing up a sort
of Prince of Wales&rsquo; feathers of mud and water round him. The
stance on the plank is no easy matter, and not a few men come to grief,
but it is soft falling in the slush. Marks are given for pace, style,
sticking to the plank, and throwing up the biggest and widest splash.
Sometimes a kind of gallows, perhaps twenty feet high, is erected on
the course, and there is a round of applause if the splash reaches up
to or above it. Sometimes the buffaloes bolt, scatter the crowd, and
get away into the young rice. At the end of the course, the driver
jumps off with a parting smack at his buffaloes, which run up the slope
of the field, and stop of themselves in what may be called the paddock.
At a big meeting perhaps a hundred pairs, brought from all over the
Tulu country, will compete, and the big men always send their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>buffaloes to the races headed by the local band.
The roads are alive with horns and tom-toms for several days. The
proceedings commence with a procession, which is not infrequently
headed by a couple of painted dolls in an attitude suggestive of that
reproductiveness, which the races really give thanks for. They are a
sort of harvest festival, before the second or sugge crop is sown, and
are usually held in October and November. Devils must be propitiated,
and the meeting opens with a devil dance. A painted, grass-crowned
devil dancer, riding a hobby-horse, proceeds with music round the
kambla field. Then comes the buffalo procession, and the races
commence. At a big meeting near Mangalore, the two leading devil
dancers were dressed up in masks, and coat and trousers of blue mission
cloth, and one had the genitalia represented by a long piece of blue
cloth tipped with red, and enormous testes. Buffaloes, young and old,
trained and untrained, compete, some without the plank attached to
them, and others with planks but without drivers. Accidents sometimes
happen, owing to the animals breaking away among the crowd. On one
occasion, a man who was in front of a pair of buffaloes which were just
about to start failed to jump clear of them. Catching hold of the yoke,
he hung on to it by his hands, and was carried right down the course,
and was landed safely at the other end. If he had dropped, he would
have fallen among four pairs of hoofs, not to mention the planks, and
would probably have been brained. It is often a case of owners up, and
the sons and nephews of big Bants, worth perhaps Rs. 10,000 a year,
drive the teams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the above account, I may add a few notes made at a buffalo
race-meeting near Udipi, at which I was present. Each group of
buffaloes, as they went up the track to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>the starting-point,
was preceded by the Koraga band playing on drum, fife and cymbals,
Holeyas armed with staves and dancing, and a man holding a flag
(nish&#257;ni). Sometimes, in addition to the flag, there is a
pakk&#275; or spear on the end of a bamboo covered with strips of
cloth, or a makara torana, <i>i.e.</i>, festooned cloths between two
bamboos. The two last are permitted only if the buffaloes belong to a
Bant or Br&#257;hman, not if they are the property of a Billava. At the
end of the races, the Ball&#257;la chief, in whose field they had taken
place, retired in procession, headed by a man carrying his banner,
which, during the races, had been floating on the top of a long bamboo
pole at the far end of the track. He was followed by the Koraga band,
and the Holeyas attached to him, armed with clubs, and dancing a step
dance amid discordant noises. Two Nalkes (devil-dancers), dressed up in
their professional garb, and a torch-bearer also joined in the
procession, in the rear of which came the Ball&#257;la beneath a
decorated umbrella. In every village there are r&#257;kshasas (demons),
called Kambla-asura, who preside over the fields. The races are held to
propitiate them, and, if they are omitted, it is believed that there
will be a failure of the crop. According to some, Kambla-asura is the
brother of Mah&#275;shasura, the buffalo-headed giant, from whom Mysore
receives its name. The Koragas sit up through the night before the
Kambla day, performing a ceremony called panikkuluni, or sitting under
the dew. They sing songs to the accompaniment of the band, about their
devil N&#299;cha, and offer toddy and a rice-pudding boiled in a large
earthen pot, which is broken so that the pudding remains as a solid
mass. This pudding is called kand&#275;l add&#275;, or pot pudding. On
the morning of the races, the Holeyas scatter manure over the field,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>plough it. On the following day, the seedlings
are planted, without, as in ordinary cases, any ploughing. To
propitiate various devils, the days following the races are devoted to
cock-fighting. The Kamblas, in different places, have various names
derived from the village deity, the chief village devil, or the village
itself, <i>e.g.</i>, Janardhana D&#275;vara, Daivala, or Udiyavar. The
young men, who have the management of the buffaloes, are called
Bannangayi Gurikara (half-ripe cocoanut masters) as they have the right
of taking tender cocoanuts, as well as beaten rice to give them
physical strength, without the special permission of their landlord. At
the village of Vandar, the races take place in a dry field, which has
been ploughed, and beaten to break up the clods of earth. For this
reason they are called podi (powder) Kambla.</p>
<p>A pair of buffaloes, belonging to the field in which the races take
place, should enter the field first, and a breach of this observance
leads to discussion and quarrels. On one occasion, a dispute arose
between two Bants in connection with the question of precedence. One of
them brought his own pair of buffaloes, and the other a borrowed pair.
If the latter had brought his own animals, he would have had precedence
over the former. But, as his animals were borrowed, precedence was
given to the man who brought his own buffaloes. This led to a dispute,
and the races were not commenced until the delicate point at issue was
decided. In some places, a long pole, called p&#363;k&#257;re,
decorated with flags, flowers, and festoons of leaves, is set up in the
Kambla field, sometimes on a platform. Billavas are in charge of this
pole, which is worshipped, throughout the races, and others may not
touch it.</p>

<p>Fines inflicted by the Bant caste council are, I am informed, spent
in the celebration of a temple festival. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>In former days, those
found guilty by the council were beaten with tamarind switches, made to
stand exposed to the sun, or big red ants were thrown over their
bodies. Sometimes, to establish the innocence of an accused person, he
had to take a piece of red-hot iron (axe, etc.) in his hand, and give
it to his accuser.</p>
<p>At a puberty ceremony among some Bants the girl sits in the
courtyard of her house on five unhusked cocoanuts covered with the
bamboo cylinder which is used for storing paddy. Women place four pots
filled with water, and containing betel leaves and nuts, round the
girl, and empty the contents over her head. She is then secluded in an
outhouse. The women are entertained with a feast, which must include
fowl and fish curry. The cocoanuts are given to a washerwoman. On the
fourth day, the girl is bathed, and received back at the house. Beaten
rice, and rice flour mixed with jaggery (crude sugar) are served out to
those assembled. The girl is kept g&#333;sha (secluded) for a time, and
fed up with generous diet.</p>
<p>Under the aliya sant&#257;na system of inheritance, the High Court
has ruled that there is no marriage within the meaning of the Penal
Code. But, though divorce and remarriage are permitted to women, there
are formal rules and ceremonies observed in connection with them, and
amongst the well-to-do classes divorce is not looked upon as
respectable, and is not frequent. The fictitious marriage prevailing
amongst the N&#257;yars is unknown among the Bants, and a wife also
usually leaves the family house, and resides at her husband&rsquo;s,
unless she occupies so senior a position in her own family as to make
it desirable that she should live on the family estate.</p>
<p>The Bants are divided into a number of balis (exogamous septs),
which are traced in the female line, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span><i>i.e.</i>, a boy
belongs to his mother&rsquo;s, not to his father&rsquo;s bali. Children
belonging to the same bali cannot marry, and the prohibition extends to
certain allied (koodu) balis. Moreover, a man cannot marry his
father&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s daughter, though she belongs to a
different bali. In a memorandum by Mr. M. Mundappa Bangera,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e10344src" href="#xd21e10344" name=
"xd21e10344src">36</a> it is stated that &ldquo;bali in aliya
sant&#257;na families corresponds to g&#333;tra of the Br&#257;hmins
governed by Hindu law, but differs in that it is derived from the
mother&rsquo;s side, whereas g&#333;tra is always derived from the
father&rsquo;s side. A marriage between a boy and girl belonging to the
same bali is considered incestuous, as falling within the prohibited
degrees of consanguinity. It is not at all difficult to find out the
bali to which a man or woman belongs, as one can scarcely be found who
does not know one&rsquo;s own bali by rote. And the heads of caste, who
preside at every wedding party, and who are also consulted by the
elders of the boy or girl before an alliance is formed, are such
experts in these matters that they decide at once without reference to
any books or rules whether intermarriages between persons brought
before them can be lawfully performed or not.&rdquo; As examples of
balis among the Bants, the following may be cited:&mdash;</p>

<li>Bellathannaya, jaggery.</li>

<p>Infant marriage is not prohibited, but is not common, and both men
and girls are usually married after they have reached maturity. There
are two forms of marriage, one called kai dh&#257;re for marriages
between virgins and bachelors, the other called budu dh&#257;re for the
marriage of widows. After a match has been arranged, the formal
betrothal, called ponnap&#257;thera or nischaya tambula, takes place.
The bridegroom&rsquo;s relatives and friends proceed in a body on the
appointed day to the bride&rsquo;s house, and are there entertained at
a grand dinner, to which the bride&rsquo;s relatives and friends are
also bidden. Subsequently the karnavans (heads) of the two families
formally engage to perform the marriage, and plates of betel leaves and
areca nuts are exchanged, and the betel and nuts partaken of by the two
parties. The actual marriage ceremony is performed at the house of the
bride or bridegroom, as may be most convenient. The proceedings
commence with the bridegroom seating himself in the marriage pandal, a
booth or canopy specially erected for the occasion. He is there shaved
by the village barber, and then retires and bathes. This done, both he
and the bride are conducted to the pandal by their relations, or
sometimes by the village headman. They walk thrice round the seat, and
then sit down side by side. The essential and binding part of the
ceremony, called dh&#257;re, then takes place. The right hand of the
bride being placed over the right hand of the bridegroom, a silver
vessel (dh&#257;re gindi) filled with water, with a cocoanut over the
mouth and the flower of the areca palm on the cocoanut, is placed on
the joined hands. The parents, the managers of the two families, and
the village headmen all touch the vessel, which, with the hands of the
bridal pair, is moved up and down three times. In certain families the
water is poured from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>vessel into the united hands of
the couple, and this betokens the gift of the bride. This form of gift
by pouring water was formerly common, and was not confined to the gift
of a bride. It still survives in the marriage ceremonies of various
castes, and the name of the Bant ceremony shows that it must once have
been universal among them. The bride and bridegroom then receive the
congratulations of the guests, who express a hope that the happy couple
may become the parents of twelve sons and twelve daughters. An empty
plate, and another containing rice, are next placed before the pair,
and their friends sprinkle them with rice from the one, and place a
small gift, generally four annas, in the other. The bridegroom then
makes a gift to the bride. This is called sirdachi, and varies in
amount according to the position of the parties. This must be returned
to the husband, if his wife leaves him, or if she is divorced for
misconduct. The bride is then taken back in procession to her home. A
few days later she is again taken to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, and
must serve her husband with food. He makes another money present to
her, and after that the marriage is consummated.</p>
<p>According to another account of the marriage ceremony among some
Bants, the barber shaves the bridegroom&rsquo;s face, using cow&rsquo;s
milk instead of water, and touches the bride&rsquo;s forehead with
razor. The bride and bridegroom bathe, and dress up in new clothes. A
plank covered with a newly-washed cloth supplied by a washerman, a tray
containing raw rice, a lighted lamp, betel leaves and areca nuts, etc.,
are placed in the pandal. A girl carries a tray on which are placed a
lighted lamp, a measure full of raw rice, and betel. She is followed by
the bridegroom conducted by her brother, and the bride, led by the
bridegroom&rsquo;s sister. They enter <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>the pandal and, after
going round the articles contained therein five times, sit down on the
plank. An elderly woman, belonging to the family of the caste headman,
brings a tray containing rice, and places it in front of the couple,
over whom she sprinkles a little of the rice. The assembled men and
women then place presents of money on the tray, and sprinkle rice over
the couple. The right hand of the bride is held by the headman, and her
uncle, and laid in that of the bridegroom. A cocoanut is placed over
the mouth of a vessel, which is decorated with mango leaves and flowers
of the areca palm. The headman and male relations of the bride place
this vessel thrice in the hands of the bridal couple. The vessel is
subsequently emptied at the foot of a cocoanut tree.</p>
<p>The foregoing account shows that the Bant marriage is a good deal
more than concubinage. It is indeed as formal a marriage as is to be
found among any people in the world, and the freedom of divorce which
is allowed cannot deprive it of its essential character. Widows are
married with much less formality. The ceremony consists simply of
joining the hands of the couple, but, strange to say, a screen is
placed between them. All widows are allowed to marry again, but it is,
as a rule, only the young women who actually do so. If a widow becomes
pregnant, she must marry or suffer loss of caste.</p>
<p>The Bants all burn their dead, except in the case of children under
seven, and those who have died of leprosy or of epidemic disease such
as cholera or small-pox. The funeral pile must consist at least partly
of mango wood. On the ninth, eleventh or thirteenth day, people are fed
in large numbers, but the Jains now substitute for this a distribution
of cocoanuts on the third, fifth, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168"
href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>seventh, or ninth day. Once a
year&mdash;generally in October&mdash;a ceremony called agel&#363; is
performed for the propitiation of ancestors.</p>
<p>From a detailed account of the Bant death ceremonies, I gather that
the news of a death is conveyed to the caste people by a Holeya. A
carpenter, accompanied by musicians, proceeds to cut down a mango tree
for the funeral pyre. The body is bathed, and laid out on a plank. Clad
in new clothes, it is conveyed with music to the burning-ground. A
barber carries thither a pot containing fire. The corpse is set down
near the pyre and divested of the new clothes, which are distributed
between a barber, washerman, carpenter, a Billava and Holeya. The pyre
is kindled by a Billava, and the mat on which the corpse has been lying
is thrown thereon by a son or nephew of the deceased. On the third day
the relations go to the burning-ground, and a barber and washerman
sprinkle water over the ashes. Some days later, the caste people are
invited to attend, and a barber, washerman, and carpenter build up on
the spot where the corpse was burnt a lofty structure, made of bamboo
and areca palm, in an odd number of tiers, and supported on an odd
number of posts. It is decorated with cloths, fruits, tender cocoanuts,
sugarcane, flowers, mango leaves, areca palm flowers, etc., and a fence
is set up round it. The sons and other relations of the deceased carry
to the burning-ground three balls of cooked rice (pinda) dyed with
turmeric and tied up in a cloth, some raw rice dyed with turmeric,
pieces of green plantain fruit, and pumpkin and a cocoanut. They go
thrice round the structure, carrying the various articles in trays on
their heads, and deposit them therein. The relations then throw a
little of the coloured rice into the structure, and one of the caste
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>men sprinkles water contained in a mango leaf
over their hands. After bathing, they return home. The clothes, jewels,
etc., of the deceased are laid on a cloth spread inside the house. A
piece of turmeric is suspended from the ceiling by a string, and a tray
containing water coloured yellow placed beneath it. Round this the
females seat themselves. A cocoanut is broken, and a barber sprinkles
the water thereof contained in a mango leaf over those assembled. On
the following day, various kinds of food are prepared, and placed on
leaves, with a piece of new cloth, within a room of the house. The
cloth remains there for a year, when it is renewed. The renewal
continues until another death occurs in the family.</p>

<p>The headman among the Bants is generally called Guttinayya, meaning
person of the guttu or site. Every village, or group of villages,
possesses a guttu, and the Bant who occupies, or holds in possession
the house or site set apart as the guttu is the Guttinayya. When this
passes to another by sale or inheritance, the office of headman passes
with it. It is said that, in some instances, the headmanship has in
this way passed to classes other than Bants, <i>e.g.</i>, Br&#257;hmans
and Jains. In some villages, the headman is, as among some other
castes, called Gurik&#257;ra, whose appointment is hereditary.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span></p>
<p>A few supplementary notes may be added on the Parivara, N&#257;d,
and M&#257;s&#257;dika Bants. The Parivaras are confined to the
southern taluks of the South Canara district. They may interdine, but
may not intermarry with the other section. The rule of inheritance is
makkalakattu (in the male line). Br&#257;hman priests are engaged for
the various ceremonials, so the Parivaras are more Br&#257;hmanised
than the N&#257;d or M&#257;s&#257;dika Bants. The Parivaras may resort
to the wells used by Br&#257;hmans, and they consequently claim
superiority over the other sections. Among the N&#257;d Bants, no
marriage badge is tied on the neck of the bride. At a Parivara
marriage, after the dh&#257;re ceremony, the bridegroom ties a gold
bead, called dh&#257;re mani, on the neck of the bride. The remarriage
of widows is not in vogue. In connection with the death ceremonies, a
car is not, as among the N&#257;d and M&#257;s&#257;dika sections, set
up over the mound (dh&#363;pe). On the eleventh day, the spreading of a
cloth on the mound for offerings of food must be done by Nekk&#257;ras,
who wash clothes for Billavas.</p>
<p>The N&#257;d or N&#257;dava and M&#257;s&#257;dika Bants follow the
aliya sant&#257;na law of succession, and intermarriage is permitted
between the two sections. The names of the balis, which have already
been given, are common among the M&#257;s&#257;dikas, and do not apply
to the N&#257;ds, among whom different sept names occur, <i>e.g.</i>,
Honne, Shetti, Koudichi, etc. Elaborate death ceremonies are only
performed if the deceased was old, or a respected member of the
community. The corpse is generally cremated in one of the rice-fields
belonging to the family. After the funeral, the male members of the
family return home, and place a vessel containing water and light in a
room. One or two women must <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href=
"#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>remain in this room, and the light
must be kept burning until the bojja, or final death ceremonies, are
over. The water in the vessel must be renewed twice daily. At the final
ceremonies, a feast is given to the castemen, and in some places, the
headman insists on the people of the house of mourning giving him a
jewel as a pledge that the bojja will be performed on the ninth,
eleventh, or thirteenth day. The headman visits the house on the
previous day, and, after examination of the provisions, helps in
cutting up vegetables, etc. On the bojja day, copper and silver coins,
and small pieces of gold, are buried or sown in the field in which the
ceremony is performed. This is called hanabiththodu. The lofty
structure, called gurigi or upparige, is set up over the dh&#363;pe or
ashes heaped up into a mound, or in the field in which the body was
cremated, only in the event of the deceased being a person of
importance. In some places, two kinds of structure are used, one called
gurigi, composed of several tiers, for males, and the other called
d&#275;lag&#363;du, consisting of a single tier, for females.
Devil-dancers are engaged, and the commonest k&#333;la performed by
them is the eru k&#333;la, or man and hobby-horse. In the room
containing the vessel of water, four sticks are planted in the ground,
and tied together. Over the sticks a cloth is placed, and the vessel of
water placed beneath it. A bit of string is tied to the ceiling, and a
piece of turmeric or a gold ring is attached to the end of it, and
suspended so as to touch the water in the vessel. This is called
n&#299;r neralu (shadow in water), and seems to be a custom among
various Tulu castes. After the bojja ceremony, all those who are under
death pollution stand in two rows. A Madavali (washerman) touches them
with a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>cloth, and a K&#275;lasi (barber) sprinkles
water over them. In this manner, they are freed from pollution.</p>
<p>The most common title among the Bants is Chetti or Setti, but many
others occur, <i>e.g.</i>, Heggade, N&#257;yaka, Bang&#275;ra, Rai,
Ball&#257;laru, etc.</p>

<p><b>B&#257;riki.&mdash;</b>B&#257;riki is the name for village
watchmen in Southern Ganjam, whose duty it further is to guide the
traveller on the march from place to place. In the Bellary Manual,
B&#257;rika is given as the name for Canarese Kabb&#275;ras, who are
village servants, who keep the village ch&#257;vadi (caste
meeting-house) clean, look after the wants of officials halting in the
village, and perform various other duties. In the Census Report, 1901,
the B&#257;rikas are said to be usually B&#333;yas. The B&#257;rika of
Mysore is defined by Mr. L. Rice as<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10479src" href="#xd21e10479" name="xd21e10479src">37</a> &ldquo;a
menial among the village servants; a deputy tal&#257;ri, who is
employed to watch the crops from the growing crop to the
granary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Bellary district, that
&ldquo;in the middle of the threshold of nearly all the gateways of the
ruined fortifications round the Bellary villages will be noticed a
roughly cylindrical or conical stone, something like a lingam. This is
the boddu-r&#257;yi, literally the navel stone, and so the middle
stone. It was planted there when the fort was built, and is
affectionately regarded as being the boundary of the village site. Once
a year, in May, just before the sowing season begins, a ceremony takes
place in connection with it. Reverence is first made to the bullocks
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>of the village, and in the evening they are
driven through the gateway past the boddu-r&#257;yi with tom-toms,
flutes, and all kinds of music. The B&#257;rike next does p&#363;ja
(worship) to the stone, and then a string of mango leaves is tied
across the gateway above it. The villagers now form sides, one party
trying to drive the bullocks through the gate, and the other trying to
keep them out. The greatest uproar and confusion naturally follow, and,
in the midst of the turmoil, some bullock or other eventually breaks
through the guardians of the gate, and gains the village. If that first
bullock is a red one, the red grains on the red soils will flourish in
the coming season. If he is white, white crops like cotton and white
cholam will prosper. If he is red-and-white, both kinds will do well.
When the rains fail, and, in any case, on the first full moon in
September, rude human figures drawn on the ground with powdered
charcoal may be seen at cross-roads and along big thoroughfares. They
represent J&#333;kum&#257;ra the rain-god, and are made by the
B&#257;rikes&mdash;a class of village servants, who are usually of the
Gaurimakkalu sub-division of the Kabb&#275;ras. The villagers give the
artists some small remuneration, and believe that luck comes to those
who pass over the figures.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;one of the worst criminal tribes of India. The sphere of their
operations extends throughout the length and breadth of the country.
They not only commit robberies, burglaries and thefts, but also
practice the art of manufacturing and passing counterfeit coin. They
keep with them a small quantity of wheat and sandal seeds in a small
tin or brass case, which they call D&#275;vakadana or God&rsquo;s
grain, and a tuft of peacock&rsquo;s feathers, all in a bundle. They
are very superstitious, and do not embark on any enterprise without
first ascertaining by omens whether it will be attended with success or
not. This they do by taking at random a small quantity of grains out of
their D&#275;vakadana and counting the number of grains, the omen being
considered good or bad according as the number of seeds is odd or even.

<p><b>B&#257;v&#257;ji.&mdash;</b>The B&#257;v&#257;jis are
Bair&#257;gi or Gos&#257;yi beggars, who travel about the country. They
are known by various names, <i>e.g.</i>, Bair&#257;gi, S&#257;du,
etc.</p>
<p><b>B&#257;vuri.&mdash;</b>The B&#257;vuris, or Bauris, are a low
class of Oriya basket-makers, living in Ganjam, and are more familiarly
known as Khod&#257;lo. They are a polluting class, living in separate
quarters, and occupy a position lower than the S&#257;mantiyas, but
higher than the Kondras, Dand&#257;sis, and Haddis. They claim that
palanquin (dhooly or d&#363;li) bearing is their traditional
occupation, and consequently call themselves B&#333;yi.
&ldquo;According to one story,&rdquo; Risley writes,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e10561src" href="#xd21e10561" name="xd21e10561src">42</a>
&ldquo;they were degraded for attempting to steal food from the banquet
of the gods; another professes to trace them back to a mythical
ancestor named B&#257;hak Rishi (the bearer of burdens), and tells how,
while returning from a marriage procession, they sold the palanquin
they had been hired to carry, got drunk on the proceeds, and assaulted
their guru (religious preceptor), who cursed them for the sacrilege,
and condemned them to rank thenceforward among the lowest castes of the
community.&rdquo; The B&#257;vuris are apparently divided into two
endogamous sections, viz., Dulia and Khandi. The former regard
themselves as superior to the latter, and prefer to be called
Khod&#257;lo. Some of these have given up eating beef, call themselves
D&#257;sa Khod&#257;los, and claim descent from one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>Balliga Doss, a famous B&#257;vuri devotee, who
is said to have worked wonders, analogous to those of Nandan of the
Paraiyan community. To this section the caste priests belong. At
Russelkonda, a woman, when asked if she was a B&#257;vuri, replied that
the caste is so called by others, but that its real name is
Khod&#257;lo. Others, in reply to a question whether they belonged to
the Khandi section, became angry, and said that the Khandis are
inferior, because they eat frogs.</p>
<p>The B&#257;vuris gave the name of two g&#333;tras, saptha bhavunia
and n&#257;ga, which are said to be exogamous. The former offer food to
the gods on seven leaves of the white gourd melon, <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Benincasa cerifera</i> (kokkara), and the latter on jak
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Artocarpus integrifolia</i>: panasa) leaves. All
over the Oriya country there is a general belief that house-names or
bamsams are foreign to the Oriya castes, and only possessed by the
Telugus. But some genuine Oriya castes, <i>e.g.</i>, Haddis,
Dand&#257;sis and Bhond&#257;ris, have exogamous bamsams.</p>
<p>For every group of villages (muttah), the B&#257;vuris apparently
have a headman called B&#275;hara, who is assisted by Naikos or Dolo
B&#275;haras, or, in some places, Dondias or Porichas, who hold sway
over a smaller number of villages. Each village has its own headman,
called Bhollobhaya (good brother), to whose notice all irregularities
are brought. These are either settled by himself, or referred to the
B&#275;hara and Naiko. In some villages, in addition to the
Bhollobhaya, there is a caste servant called Dangua or Dogara. For
serious offences, a council-meeting is convened by the B&#275;hara, and
attended by the Bhollobhayas, Naikos, and a few leading members of the
community. The meeting is held in an open plain outside the village.
Once in two or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>three years, a council-meeting, called mondolo,
is held, at which various matters are discussed, and decided. The
expenses of meetings are defrayed by the inhabitants of the villages in
which they take place. Among the most important matters to be decided
by tribunals are adultery, eating with lower castes, the re-admission
of convicts into the caste, etc. Punishment takes the form of a fine,
and trial by ordeal is apparently not resorted to. A man, who is
convicted of committing adultery, or eating with a member of a lower
caste, is received back into the caste on payment of the fine. A woman,
who has been proved guilty of such offences, is not so taken back. It
is said that, when a member of a higher caste commits adultery with a
B&#257;vuri woman, he is sometimes received into the B&#257;vuri caste.
The B&#275;hara receives a small fee annually from each village or
family, and also a small present of money for each marriage.</p>
<p>Girls are married either before or after puberty. A man may marry
his maternal uncle&rsquo;s, but not his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter.
At an adult marriage, the festivities last for four days, whereas, at
an infant marriage, they are extended over seven days. When a young
man&rsquo;s parents have selected a girl for him, they consult a
Br&#257;hman, and, if he decides that the marriage will be auspicious,
they proceed to the girl&rsquo;s home, and ask that a day be fixed for
the betrothal. On the appointed day the amount of money, which is to be
paid by the bridegroom-elect for jewels, etc., is fixed. One or two new
cloths must be given to the girl&rsquo;s grandmother, and the
man&rsquo;s party must announce the number of feasts they intend to
give to the castemen. If the family is poor, the feasts are mentioned,
but do not actually take place. The marriage ceremony is always
celebrated at night. On the evening of the day prior thereto, the bride
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>bridegroom&rsquo;s people proceed to the temple
of the village goddess (T&#257;kur&#257;ni), and, on their way home, go
to seven houses of members of their own or some higher caste, and ask
them to give them water, which is poured into a small vessel. This
vessel is taken home, and hung over the bedi (marriage dais). The water
is used by the bride and bridegroom on the following morning for
bathing. On the marriage day, the bridegroom proceeds to the
bride&rsquo;s village, and is met on the way by her party, and escorted
by his brother-in-law to the dais. The Bhollobhaya enquires whether the
bride&rsquo;s party have received everything as arranged, and, when he
has been assured on this point, the bride is brought to the dais by her
maternal uncle. She carries with her in her hands a little salt and
rice; and, after throwing these over the bridegroom, she sits by his
side. The grandfathers of the contracting couple, or a priest called
Dhiy&#257;ni, officiate. Their palms are placed together, and the hands
united by a string dyed with turmeric. The union of the hands is called
hasthagonti, and is the binding portion of the ceremony. Turmeric water
is poured over the hands seven times from a chank or sankha shell.
Seven married women then throw over the heads of the couple a mixture
of <i lang="la-x-bio">Zizyphus Jujuba</i> (borkolipathro) leaves, rice
smeared with turmeric, and <i lang="la-x-bio">Cynodon Dactylon</i>
(dh&#363;ba) culms. This rite is called bhondaivaro, and is performed
at all auspicious ceremonies. The fingers of the bride and bridegroom
are then linked together, and they are led by the wife of the
bride&rsquo;s brother seven times round the bedi. The priest then
proclaims that the soot can soon be wiped off the cooking-pot, but the
connection brought about by the marriage is enduring, and relationship
is secured for seven generations. The pair are taken indoors, and fed.
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>remaining days of the marriage ceremonies are
given up to feasting. The remarriage of widows is permitted. A widow is
expected to marry the younger brother of her deceased husband, or, with
his permission, may marry whom she likes.</p>
<p>When a girl attains maturity, she is seated on a new mat, and
<i lang="la-x-bio">Zizyphus Jujuba</i> leaves are thrown over her. This
ceremony is sometimes repeated daily for six days, during which sweets,
etc., are given to the girl, and women who bring presents are fed. On
the seventh day, the girl is taken to a tank (pond), and bathed.</p>
<p>The dead are either buried or burnt. The corpse is, at the funeral,
borne in the hands, or on a bier, by four men. Soon after the village
boundary has been crossed, the widow of the deceased throws rice over
the eyes of the corpse, and also a little fire, after taking it three
times round. She usually carries with her a pot and ladle, which she
throws away. If an elderly woman dies, these rites are performed by her
daughter-in-law. At the burial-ground, the corpse is taken seven times
round the grave, and, as it is lowered into it, those present say
&ldquo;Oh! trees, Oh! sky, Oh! earth, we are laying him in. It is not
our fault.&rdquo; When the grave has been filled in, the figures of a
man and woman are drawn on it, and all throw earth over it, saying
&ldquo;You were living with us; now you have left us. Do not trouble
the people.&rdquo; On their return home, the mourners sprinkle cowdung
water about the house and over their feet, and toddy is partaken of. On
the following day, all the old pots are thrown away, and the agnates
eat rice cooked with margosa (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>)
leaves. Food is offered to the dead person, either at the burial-ground
or in the backyard of the house. On the tenth day, the Dhiyani,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>as the priest is called, is sent for, and
arrives with his drum (dhiyani). A small hut is erected on a tank bund
(embankment), and food cooked seven times, and offered seven times on
seven fragments of pots. A new cloth is spread, and on it food, fruits,
a chank shell, etc., are placed, and offered to the deceased. The
various articles are put into a new pot, and the son, going into the
water up to his neck, throws the pot into the air, and breaks it. The
celebrants of the rite then return to the house, and stand in a row in
front thereof. They are there purified by means of milk smeared over
their hands by the Dhiyani. On the twelfth day, food is offered on
twelve leaves.</p>
<p>The B&#257;vuris do not worship Jagann&#257;th&#257;sw&#257;mi, or
other of the higher deities, but reverence their ancestors and the
village goddesses or T&#257;kur&#257;nis. Like other Oriya classes, the
B&#257;vuris name their children on the twenty-first day. Opprobrious
names are common among them, <i>e.g.</i>, Og&#257;du (dirty fellow),
Kang&#257;li (wretched fellow), Haddia (Haddi, or sweeper caste).</p>
<p><b>B&#275;dar or B&#333;ya.&mdash;</b>&ldquo;Throughout the
hills,&rdquo; Buchanan writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10615src"
href="#xd21e10615" name="xd21e10615src">43</a> &ldquo;northward from
Capaladurga, are many cultivated spots, in which, during Tippoo&rsquo;s
government, were settled many Baydaru or hunters, who received twelve
pagodas (&pound;4 5<i>s.</i>) a year, and served as irregular troops
whenever required. Being accustomed to pursue tigers and deer in the
woods, they were excellent marksmen with their match-locks, and
indefatigable in following their prey; which, in the time of war, was
the life and property of every helpless creature that came in their
way. During the wars of Hyder and his son, these men were chief
instruments in the terrible depredations <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>committed in the
lower Carnatic. They were also frequently employed with success against
the Poligars (feudal chiefs), whose followers were of a similar
description.&rdquo; In the Gazetteer of the Anantapur district it is
noted that &ldquo;the B&#333;yas are the old fighting caste of this
part of the country, whose exploits are so often recounted in the
history books. The Poligars&rsquo; forces, and Haidar Ali&rsquo;s
famous troops were largely recruited from these people, and they still
retain a keen interest in sport and manly exercises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his notes on the B&#333;yas, which Mr. N. E. Q. Mainwaring has
kindly placed at my disposal, he writes as follows. &ldquo;Although,
until quite recently, many a B&#333;ya served in the ranks of our
Native army, being entered in the records thereof either under his
caste title of Naidu, or under the heading of Gentu,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e10625src" href="#xd21e10625" name="xd21e10625src">44</a> which
was largely used in old day military records, yet this congenial method
of earning a livelihood has now been swept away by a Government order,
which directs that in future no Telegas shall be enlisted into the
Indian army. That the B&#333;yas were much prized as fighting men in
the stirring times of the eighteenth century is spoken to in the
contemporaneous history of Colonel Wilks.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10631src" href="#xd21e10631" name="xd21e10631src">45</a> He
speaks of the brave armies of the Poligars of Chitteldroog, who
belonged to the Beder or B&#333;ya race in the year 1755. Earlier, in
1750, Hyder Ali, who was then only a Naik in the service of the Mysore
R&#257;ja, used with great effect his select corps of Beder peons at
the battle of Ginjee. Five years after this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>battle, when Hyder was rising to great eminence,
he augmented his Beder peons, and used them as scouts for the purpose
of ascertaining the whereabouts of his enemies, and for poisoning with
the juice of the milk-hedge (<i>Euphorbia Tirucalli</i>) all wells in
use by them, or in their line of march. The historian characterises
them as being &lsquo;brave and faithful thieves.&rsquo; In 1751, the
most select army of Morari Row of Gooty consisted chiefly of Beder
peons, and the accounts of their deeds in the field, as well as their
defence of Gooty fort, which only fell after the meanness of device had
been resorted to, prove their bravery in times gone by beyond doubt.
There are still a number of old weapons to be found amongst the
B&#333;yas, consisting of swords, daggers, spears, and matchlocks. None
appear to be purely B&#333;ya weapons, but they seem to have assumed
the weapons of either Muhammadans or Hindus, according to which race
held sway at the time. In some districts, there are still B&#333;ya
Poligars, but, as a rule, they are poor, and unable to maintain any
position. Generally, the B&#333;yas live at peace with their
neighbours, occasionally only committing a grave dacoity
(robbery).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10639src" href="#xd21e10639"
name="xd21e10639src">46</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Kurnool district, they have a bad name, and many are
on the police records as habitual thieves and housebreakers. They
seldom stoop to lesser offences. Some are carpenters, others
blacksmiths who manufacture all sorts of agricultural implements. Some,
again, are engaged as watchmen, and others make excellent snares for
fish out of bamboo. But the majority of them are agriculturists, and
most of them work on their own putta lands. They are now a
hard-working, industrious people, who have become thrifty by dint of
their industry, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183"
name="pb183">183</a>]</span>and whose former predatory habits are being
forgotten. Each village, or group of villages, submits to the authority
of a headman, who is generally termed the Naidu, less commonly Dora as
chieftain. In some parts of Kurnool, the headmen are called Simhasana
B&#333;yas. The headman presides at all functions, and settles, with
the assistance of the elders, any disputes that may arise in the
community regarding division of property, adultery, and other matters.
The headman has the power to inflict fines, the amount of which is
regulated by the status and wealth of the defaulter. But it is always
arranged that the penalty shall be sufficient to cover the expense of
feeding the panchayatdars (members of council), and leave a little over
to be divided between the injured party and the headman. In this way,
the headman gets paid for his services, and practically fixes his own
remuneration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is stated in the Manual of the Bellary district that &ldquo;of
the various Hindu castes in Bellary, the B&#333;yas (called in Canarese
B&#275;dars, By&#275;das, or By&#257;d&#257;s) are far the strongest
numerically. Many of the Poligars whom Sir Thomas Munro found in
virtual possession of the country when it was added to the Company
belonged to this caste, and their irregular levies, and also a large
proportion of Haidar&rsquo;s formidable force, were of the same breed.
Harpanahalli was the seat of one of the most powerful Poligars in the
district in the eighteenth century. The founder of the family was a
B&#333;ya tali&#257;ri, who, on the subversion of the Vijayanagar
dynasty, seized on two small districts near Harpanahalli. The
B&#333;yas are perhaps the only people in the district who still retain
any aptitude for manly sports. They are now for the most part
cultivators and herdsmen or are engaged under Government as constables,
peons, village watchmen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href=
"#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>(tali&#257;ris), and so forth.
Their community provides an instructive example of the growth of caste
sub-divisions. Both the Telugu-speaking B&#333;yas and the
Canarese-speaking B&#275;dars are split into the two main divisions of
&#362;ru or village men, and My&#257;sa or grass-land men, and each of
these divisions is again sub-divided into a number of exogamous
Bedagas. Four of the best known of these sub-divisions are Yemmalavaru
or buffalo-men; Mandalavaru or men of the herd; P&#363;lavaru or
flower-men, and M&#299;nalavaru or fish-men. They are in no way
totemistic. Curiously enough, each Bedagu has its own particular god,
to which its members pay special reverence. But these Bedagas bear the
same names among both the B&#333;yas and the B&#275;dars, and also
among both the &#362;ru and My&#257;sa divisions of both B&#333;yas and
B&#275;dars. It thus seems clear that, at some distant period, all the
B&#333;yas and all the B&#275;dars must have belonged to one
homogeneous caste. At present, though &#362;ru B&#333;yas will marry
with &#362;ru B&#275;dars and My&#257;sa B&#333;yas with My&#257;sa
B&#275;dars, there is no intermarriage between &#362;rus and
My&#257;sas, whether they be B&#333;yas or B&#275;dars. Even if
&#362;rus and My&#257;sas dine together, they sit in different rows,
each division by themselves. Again, the &#362;rus (whether B&#333;yas
or B&#275;dars) will eat chicken and drink alcohol, but the My&#257;sas
will not touch a fowl or any form of strong drink, and are so strict in
this last matter that they will not even sit on mats made of the leaf
of the date-palm, the tree which in Bellary provides all the toddy. The
&#362;rus, moreover, celebrate their marriages with the ordinary
ceremonial of the h&#257;lu-kamba or milk-post, and the surge, or
bathing of the happy pair; the bride sits on a flour-grinding stone,
and the bridegroom stands on a basket full of cholam (millet), and they
call in Br&#257;hmans to officiate. But the My&#257;sas have a simpler
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>ritual, which omits most of these points, and
dispenses with the Br&#257;hman. Other differences are that the
&#362;ru women wear ravikkais or tight-fitting bodices, while the
My&#257;sas tuck them under their waist-string. Both divisions eat
beef, and both have a hereditary headman called the ejam&#257;n, and
hereditary D&#257;saris who act as their priests.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1901, it is stated that the two main
divisions of B&#333;yas are called also Pedda (big) and Chinna (small)
respectively, and, according to another account, the caste has four
endogamous sections, Pedda, Chinna, Sadaru, and My&#257;sa. Sadaru is
the name of a sub-division of Ling&#257;yats, found mainly in the
Bellary and Anantapur districts, where they are largely engaged in
cultivation. Some B&#275;dars who live amidst those Ling&#257;yats call
themselves Sadaru. According to the Manual of the North Arcot district,
the B&#333;yas are a &ldquo;Telugu hunting caste, chiefly found above
the gh&#257;ts. Many of the Poligars of that part of the country used
to belong to the caste, and proved themselves so lawless that they were
dispossessed. Now they are usually cultivators. They have several
divisions, the chief of which are the Mulki B&#333;yas and the
P&#257;la B&#333;yas, who cannot intermarry.&rdquo; According to the
Mysore Census Reports, 1891 and 1901, &ldquo;the B&#275;das have two
distinct divisions, the Kannada and Telugu, and own some twenty
sub-divisions, of which the following are the chief:&mdash;H&#257;lu,
M&#257;chi or My&#257;sa, N&#257;yaka, Pallegar, B&#257;rika,
Kannaiyyanaj&#257;ti, and Kir&#257;taka. The M&#257;chi or My&#257;sa
B&#275;das comprise a distinct sub-division, also called the Chunchus.
They live mostly in hills, and outside inhabited places in temporary
huts. Portions of their community had, it is alleged, been coerced into
living in villages, with whose descendants the others <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>have
kept up social intercourse. They do not, however, eat fowl or pork, but
partake of beef; and the My&#257;sa B&#275;das are the only Hindu class
among whom the rite of circumcision is performed,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10663src" href="#xd21e10663" name="xd21e10663src">47</a> on boys
of ten or twelve years of age. These customs, so characteristic of the
Mussalmans, seem to have been imbibed when the members of this
sub-caste were included in the hordes of Haidar Ali. Simultaneously
with the circumcision, other rites, such as the p&#257;nchagavyam, the
burning of the tongue with a n&#299;m (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia
Azadirachta</i>) stick, etc. (customs pre-eminently Brahmanical), are
likewise practised prior to the youth being received into communion.
Among their other peculiar customs, the exclusion from their ordinary
dwellings of women in child-bed and in periodical sickness, may be
noted. The My&#257;sa B&#275;das are said to scrupulously avoid liquor
<span class="corr" id="xd21e10669" title="Source: or">of</span> every
kind, and eat the flesh of only two kinds of birds, viz., gauja (grey
partridge), and lavga (rock-bush quail).&rdquo; Of circumcision among
the My&#257;sa B&#275;dars it is noted, in the Gazetteer of the Bellary
district, that they practise this rite round about Rayadr&#363;g and
Gudek&#333;ta. &ldquo;These My&#257;sas seem quite proud of the custom,
and scout with scorn the idea of marrying into any family in which it
is not the rule. The rite is performed when a boy is seven or eight. A
very small piece of the skin is cut off by a man of the caste, and the
boy is then kept for eleven days in a separate hut, and touched by no
one. His food is given him on a piece of stone. On the twelfth day he
is bathed, given a new cloth, and brought back to the house, and his
old cloth, and the stone on which his food was served, are thrown away.
His relations in a body then take him to a tang&#275;du <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>(<i lang="la-x-bio">Cassia auriculata</i>) bush,
to which are offered cocoanuts, flowers, and so forth, and which is
worshipped by them and him. Girls on first attaining puberty are
similarly kept for eleven days in a separate hut, and afterwards made
to do worship to a tang&#275;du bush. This tree also receives reverence
at funerals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The titles of the B&#333;yas are said to be Naidu or Nayudu, Naik,
Dora, Dorabidda (children of chieftains), and Valmiki. They claim
direct lineal descent from Valmiki, the author of the R&#257;mayana. At
times of census in Mysore, some B&#275;dars have set themselves up as
Valmiki Br&#257;hmans. The origin of the My&#257;sa B&#275;das is
accounted for in the following story. A certain B&#275;dar woman had
two sons, of whom the elder, after taking his food, went to work in the
fields. The younger son, coming home, asked his mother to give him
food, and she gave him only cholam (millet) and vegetables. While he
was partaking thereof, he recognised the smell of meat, and was angry
because his mother had given him none, and beat her to death. He then
searched the house, and, on opening a pot from which the smell of meat
emanated, found that it only contained the rotting fibre-yielding bark
of some plant. Then, cursing his luck, he fled to the forest, where he
remained, and became the forefather of the My&#257;sa B&#275;dars.</p>
<p>For the following note on the legendary origin of the B&#275;dars, I
am indebted to Mr. Mainwaring. &ldquo;Many stories are told of how they
came into existence, each story bringing out the name which the
particular group may be known by. Some call themselves Nishadulu, and
claim to be the legitimate descendants of Nishadu. When the great
Venudu, who was directly descended from Brahma, ruled over the
universe, he was unable to procure a son and heir to the throne. When
he died, his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>death was regarded as an irreparable misfortune.
In grief and doubt as to what was to be done, his body was preserved.
The seven ruling planets, then sat in solemn conclave, and consulted
together as to what they should do. Finally they agreed to create a
being from the right thigh of the deceased Venudu, and they accordingly
fashioned and gave life to Nishudu. But their work was not successful,
for Nishudu turned out to be not only deformed in body, but repulsively
ugly. It was accordingly agreed, at another meeting of the planets,
that he was not a fit person to be placed on the throne. So they set to
work again, and created a being from the right shoulder of Venudu.
Their second effort was crowned with success. They called their second
creation Chakravati, and, as he gave general satisfaction, he was
placed on the throne. This supersession naturally caused Nishudu, the
first born, to be discontented, and he sought a lonely place. There he
communed with the gods, begging of them the reason why they had created
him, if he was not to rule. The gods explained to him that he could not
now be put on the throne, since Chakravati had already been installed,
but that he should be a ruler over the forests. In this capacity,
Nishudu begot the Koravas, Chenchus, Y&#257;n&#257;dis, and B&#333;yas.
The B&#333;yas were his legitimate children, while the others were all
illegitimate. According to the legend narrated in the Valmiki
R&#257;mayana, when king Vishwamitra quarrelled with the Rishi
Vashista, the cow Kamadenu belonging to the latter, grew angry, and
shook herself. From her body an army, which included Nishadulu, Turka
(Muhammadans), and Yevannudu (Yerukalas) at once appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A myth related by the B&#333;yas in explanation of their name
Valmikudu runs as follows. In former days, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>a
Br&#257;hman, who lived as a highwayman, murdering and robbing all the
travellers he came across, kept a B&#333;ya female, and begot children
by her. One day, when he went out to carry on his usual avocation, he
met the seven Rishis, who were the incarnations of the seven planets.
He ordered them to deliver their property, or risk their lives. The
Rishis consented to give him all their property, which was little
enough, but warned him that one day he would be called to account for
his sinful deeds. The Br&#257;hman, however, haughtily replied that he
had a large family to maintain, and, as they lived on his plunder, they
would have to share the punishment that was inflicted upon himself. The
Rishis doubted this, and advised him to go and find out from his family
if they were willing to suffer an equal punishment with him for his
sins. The Br&#257;hman went to his house, and confessed his misdeeds to
his wife, explaining that it was through them that he had been able to
keep the family in luxury. He then told her of his meeting with the
Rishis, and asked her if she would share his responsibility. His wife
and children emphatically refused to be in any way responsible for his
sins, which they declared were entirely his business. Being at his
wit&rsquo;s end, he returned to the Rishis, told them how unfortunate
he was in his family affairs, and begged advice of them as to what he
should do to be absolved from his sins. They told him that he should
call upon the god R&#257;ma for forgiveness. But, owing to his bad
bringing up and his misspent youth, he was unable to utter the
god&rsquo;s name. So the Rishis taught him to say it backwards by
syllables, thus:&mdash;ma ra, ma ra, ma ra, which, by rapid repetition
a number of times, gradually grew into R&#257;ma. When he was able to
call on his god without difficulty, the Br&#257;hman sat at the scene
of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>graver sins, and did penance. White-ants came
out of the ground, and gradually enveloped him in a heap. After he had
been thus buried alive, he became himself a Rishi, and was known as
Valmiki Rishi, valmiki meaning an ant-hill. As he had left children by
the B&#333;ya woman who lived with him during his prodigal days, the
B&#333;yas claim to be descended from these children and call
themselves Valmikudu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The B&#275;dars, whom I examined at Hospet in the Bellary district,
used to go out on hunting expeditions, equipped with guns, deer or hog
spears, nets like lawn-tennis nets used in drives for young deer or
hares. Several men had cicatrices, as the result of encounters with
wild boars during hunting expeditions, or when working in the sugar
plantations. It is noted in the Bellary Gazetteer that &ldquo;the only
caste which goes in for manly sports seems to be the B&#333;yas, or
B&#275;dars, as they are called in Canarese. They organise drives for
pig, hunt bears in some parts in a fearless manner, and are regular
attendants at the village gymnasium (garidi mane), a building without
any ventilation often constructed partly underground, in which the
ideal exercise consists in using dumbbells and clubs until a profuse
perspiration follows. They get up wrestling matches, tie a band of
straw round one leg, and challenge all and sundry to remove it, or back
themselves to perform feats of strength, such as running up the steep
Joladar&#257;si hill near Hospet with a bag of grain on their
back.&rdquo; At Hospet wrestling matches are held at a quiet spot
outside the town, to witness which a crowd of many hundreds collect.
The wrestlers, who performed before me, had the hair shaved clean
behind so that the adversary could not seize them by the back hair, and
the moustache was trimmed short for the same reason. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>Two
young wrestlers, whose measurements I place on record, were splendid
specimens of youthful muscularity.</p>

<p>In the Gazetteer of Anantapur it is stated that the Telugu New
Year&rsquo;s day is the great occasion for driving pig, and the
B&#333;yas are the chief organisers of the beats. All except children,
the aged and infirm, join in them, and, since to have good sport is
held to be the best of auguries for the coming year, the excitement
aroused is almost ludicrous in its intensity. It runs so high that the
parties from rival villages have been known to use their weapons upon
one another, instead of upon the beasts of the chase. In an article
entitled &ldquo;B&#333;yas and bears&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10741src" href="#xd21e10741" name="xd21e10741src">48</a> a
European sportsman gives the following graphic description of a bear
hunt. &ldquo;We used to sleep out on the top of one of the hills on a
moonlight night. On the top of every hill round, a B&#333;ya was
watching for the bears to come home at dawn, and frantic signals showed
when one had been spotted. We hurried off to the place, to try and cut
the bear off from his residence among the boulders, but the country was
terribly rough, and the hills were covered with a peculiarly persistent
wait-a-bit-thorn. This, however, did not baulk the B&#333;yas. Telling
me to wait outside the jumble of rocks, each man took off his turban,
wound it round his left forearm, to act as a shield against attacks
from the bear, lit a rude torch, grasped his long iron-headed spear,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>coolly walked into the inky blackness of the
enemy&rsquo;s stronghold, to turn him out for me to shoot at. I used to
feel ashamed of the minor part assigned to me in the entertainment, and
asked to be allowed to go inside with them. But this suggestion was
always respectfully, but very firmly put aside. One could not see to
shoot in such darkness, they explained, and, if one fired, smoke hung
so long in the still air of the caves that the bear obtained an
unpleasant advantage, and, finally, bullets fired at close quarters
into naked rock were apt to splash or re-bound in an uncanny manner. So
I had to wait outside until the bear appeared with a crowd of cheering
and yelling B&#333;yas after him.&rdquo; Of a certain cunning bear the
same writer records that, unable to shake the B&#333;yas off, &ldquo;he
had at last taken refuge at the bottom of a sort of dark pit,
&lsquo;four men deep&rsquo; as the B&#333;yas put it, under a ledge of
rock, where neither spears nor torches could reach him. Not to be
beaten, three of the B&#333;yas at length clambered down after him, and
unable otherwise to get him to budge from under the mass of rock
beneath which he had squeezed himself, fired a cheap little
nickel-plated revolver one of them had brought twice into his face. The
bear then concluded that his refuge was after all an unhealthy spot,
rushed out, knocking one of the three men against the rocks as he did
so, with a force which badly barked one shoulder, clambered out of the
pit, and was thereafter kept straight by the B&#333;yas until he got to
the entrance of his residence, where I was waiting for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mainwaring writes that &ldquo;the B&#333;yas are adepts at
shikar (hunting). They use a bullock to stalk antelope, which they
shoot with matchlocks. Some keep a tame buck, which they let loose in
the vicinity of a herd of antelope, having previously fastened a net
over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>his horns. As soon as the tame animal approaches
the herd, the leading buck will come forward to investigate the
intruder. The tame buck does not run away, as he probably would if he
had been brought up from infancy to respect the authority of the buck
of the herd. A fight naturally ensues, and the exchange of a few butts
finds them fastened together by the net. It is then only necessary for
the shik&#257;ris to rush up, and finish the strife with a
knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among other occupations, the B&#333;yas and B&#275;dars collect
honey-combs, which, in some places, have to be gathered from crevices
in overhanging rocks, which have to be skilfully manipulated from above
or below.</p>
<p>The B&#275;dar men, whom I saw during the rainy season, wore a black
woollen kambli (blanket) as a body-cloth, and it was also held over the
head as a protection against the driving showers of the south-west
monsoon. The same cloth further does duty as a basket for bringing back
to the town heavy loads of grass. Some of the men wore a garment with
the waist high up in the chest, something like an English
rustic&rsquo;s smock frock. Those who worked in the fields carried
steel tweezers on a string round the loins, with which to remove
b&#257;b&#363;l (<i lang="la-x-bio">Acacia arabica</i>) thorns, twigs
of which tree are used as a protective hedge for fields under
cultivation. As examples of charms worn by men the following may be
cited:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">String tied round right upper arm with metal talisman
box attached to it, to drive away devils. String round ankle for the

<p>Quarter-anna rolled up in cotton cloth, and worn on upper arm in

with a figure of Hanum&#257;n (the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194"
href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>monkey god) over the deltoid
muscle to remove the pain.</p>
<p>Necklet of coral and ivory beads worn as a vow to the Goddess
Huligamma, whose shrine is in Hyderabad.</p>
<p>Necklets of ivory beads and a gold disc with the Vishnup&#257;d
(feet of Vishnu) engraved on it. Purchased from a religious mendicant
to bring good luck.</p>
</div>
<p>My&#257;sa B&#275;dar women are said<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e10773src" href="#xd21e10773" name="xd21e10773src">49</a> to be
debarred from wearing toe-rings. Both &#362;ru and My&#257;sa women are
tattooed on the face, and on the upper extremities with elaborate
designs of cars, scorpions, centipedes, S&#299;ta&rsquo;s jade (plaited
hair), Hanum&#257;n, parrots, etc. Men are branded by the priest of a
Hanum&#257;n shrine on the shoulders with the emblem of the chank shell
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Turbinella rapa</i>) and chakram (wheel of the law)
in the belief that it enables them to go to Swarga (heaven). When a
My&#257;sa man is branded, he has to purchase a cylindrical basket
called gop&#257;la made by a special M&#275;dara woman, a bamboo stick,
fan, and winnow. Female B&#275;dars who are branded become Basavis
(dedicated prostitutes), and are dedicated to a male deity, and called
Gandu Basavi&#333;ru (male Basavis). They are thus dedicated when there
happens to be no male child in a family; or, if a girl falls ill, a vow
is made to the effect that, if she recovers, she shall become a Basavi.
If a son is born to such a woman, he is affiliated with her
father&rsquo;s family. Some B&#275;dar women, whose house deities are
goddesses instead of gods, are not branded, but a string with white
bone beads strung on it, and a gold disc with two feet (Vishnup&#257;d)
impressed on it, is tied round their neck by a Kuruba woman called
Pattantha Ellamma (priestess <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href=
"#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>to Uligamma). B&#275;dar girls,
whose house deities are females, when they are dedicated as Basavis,
have in like manner a necklace, but with black beads, tied round the
neck, and are called Hennu Basavis (female Basavis). For the ceremony
of dedication to a female deity, the presence of the M&#257;diga
goddess M&#257;tangi is necessary. The M&#257;digas bring a bent iron
rod with a cup at one end, and twigs of <i lang="la-x-bio">Vitex
Negundo</i> to represent the goddess, to whom goats are sacrificed. The
iron rod is set up in front of the doorway, a wick and oil are placed
in the cup, and the impromptu lamp is lighted. Various cooked articles
of food are offered, and partaken of by the assembled B&#275;dars.
B&#275;dar women sometimes live in concubinage with Muhammadans. And
some B&#275;dars, at the time of the Mohurram festival, wear a thread
across the chest like Muhammadans, and may not enter their houses till
they have washed themselves.</p>
<p>According to the Mysore Census Report, 1901, the chief deity of the
B&#275;dars is &ldquo;Tirupati Venkatar&#257;manasw&#257;mi worshipped
locally under the name of Tirumalad&#275;varu, but offerings and
sacrifices are also made to M&#257;riamma. Their guru is known as
Tirumalatatach&#257;rya, who is also a head of the Sr&#299;vaishnava
Br&#257;hmans. The &#362;ru B&#333;yas employ Br&#257;hmans and Jangams
as priests.&rdquo; In addition to the deities mentioned, the
B&#275;dars worship a variety of minor gods, such as Kanimiraya,
Kanakarayan, Uligamma, Palaya, Poleramma, and others, to whom offerings
of fruits and vegetables, and sacrifices of sheep and goats are made.
The Dew&#257;n of Sand&#363;r informs me that, in recent times, some
My&#257;sa B&#275;dars have changed their faith, and are now Saivas,
showing special reverence to Mahad&#275;va. They were apparently
converted by Jangams, but not to the fullest extent. The guru is the
head of the Ujjani Lingayat matt (religious institution) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>in
the Kudligi t&#257;luk of Bellary. They do not wear the lingam. In the
Madras Census Report, 1901, the patron deity of the B&#333;yas is said
to be Kany&#257; D&#275;vudu.</p>
<p>Concerning the religion of the B&#333;yas, Mr. Mainwaring writes as
follows. &ldquo;They worship both Siva and Vishnu, and also different
gods in different localities. In the North Arcot district, they worship
Tirupatisw&#257;mi. In Kurnool, it is Kany&#257; D&#275;vudu. In
Cuddapah and Anantap&#363;r, it is Chendrugadu, and many, in
Anantap&#363;r, worship Akkamma, who is believed to be the spirit of
the seven virgins. At Uravakonda, in the Anantap&#363;r district, on
the summit of an enormous rock, is a temple dedicated to Akkamma, in
which the seven virgins are represented by seven small golden pots or
vessels. Cocoanuts, rice, and dal (<i lang="la-x-bio">Cajanus
indicus</i>) form the offerings of the B&#333;yas. The women, on the
occasion of the N&#257;galasauthi or snake festival, worship the
N&#257;gala sw&#257;mi by fasting, and pouring milk into the holes of
&lsquo;white-ant&rsquo; hills. By this, a double object is fulfilled.
The &lsquo;ant&rsquo; heap is a favourite dwelling of the n&#257;ga or
cobra, and it was the burial-place of V&#257;lm&#299;ki, so homage is
paid to the two at the same time. Once a year, a festival is celebrated
in honour of the deceased ancestors. This generally takes place about
the end of November. The B&#333;yas make no use of Br&#257;hmans for
religious purposes. They are only consulted as regards the auspicious
hour at which to tie the t&#257;li at a wedding. Though the B&#333;ya
finds little use for the Br&#257;hman, there are times when the latter
needs the services of the B&#333;ya. The B&#333;ya cannot be dispensed
with, if a Br&#257;hman wishes to perform Vontigadu, a ceremony by
which he hopes to induce favourable auspices under which to celebrate a
marriage. The story has it that Vontigadu was a destitute B&#333;ya,
who died from starvation. It is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197"
href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>possible that Br&#257;hmans
and S&#363;dras hope in some way to ameliorate the sufferings of the
race to which Vontigadu belonged, by feeding sumptuously his modern
representative on the occasion of performing the Vontigadu ceremony. On
the morning of the day on which the ceremony, for which favourable
auspices are required, is performed, a B&#333;ya is invited to the
house. He is given a present of gingelly (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Sesamum</i>) oil, wherewith to anoint himself. This done, he
returns, carrying in his hand a dagger, on the point of which a lime
has been stuck. He is directed to the cowshed, and there given a good
meal. After finishing the meal, he steals from the shed, and dashes out
of the house, uttering a piercing yell, and waving his dagger. He on no
account looks behind him. The inmates of the house follow for some
distance, throwing water wherever he has trodden. By this means, all
possible evil omens for the coming ceremony are done away
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gather<a class="noteref" id="xd21e10800src" href="#xd21e10800"
name="xd21e10800src">50</a> that some B&#333;yas in the Bellary
district &ldquo;enjoy in&#257;m (rent free) lands for propitiating the
village goddesses by a certain rite called bh&#363;ta bali. This takes
place on the last day of the feast of the village goddess, and is
intended to secure the prosperity of the village. The B&#333;ya priest
gets himself shaved at about midnight, sacrifices a sheep or a buffalo,
mixes its blood with rice, and distributes the rice thus prepared in
small balls throughout the limits of the village. When he starts out on
this business, the whole village bolts its doors, as it is not
considered auspicious to see him then. He returns early in the morning
to the temple of the goddess from which he started, bathes, and
receives new cloths from the villagers.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p>At Hospet the B&#275;dars have two buildings called ch&#257;vadis,
built by subscription among members of their community, which they use
as a meeting place, and whereat caste councils are held. At Sand&#363;r
the &#362;ru B&#275;dars submit their disputes to their guru, a
Sr&#299;vaishnava Br&#257;hman, for settlement. If a case ends in a
verdict of guilty against an accused person, he is fined, and purified
by the guru with th&#299;rtham (holy water). In the absence of the
guru, a caste headman, called Kattaintivadu, sends a D&#257;sari, who
may or may not be a B&#275;dar, who holds office under the guru, to
invite the castemen and the Samaya, who represents the guru in his
absence, to attend a caste meeting. The Samayas are the
p&#363;j&#257;ris at Hanum&#257;n and other shrines, and perform the
branding ceremony, called chakr&#257;nkitam. The My&#257;sa B&#275;dars
have no guru, but, instead of him, p&#363;j&#257;ris belonging to their
own caste, who are in charge of the affairs of certain groups of
families. Their caste messenger is called Dalavai.</p>

<p>At Hospet, the preliminaries of a marriage among the My&#257;sa
B&#275;dars are arranged by the parents of the parties concerned and
the chief men of the k&#275;ri (street). On the wedding day, the bride
and bridegroom sit on a raised platform, and five married men place
rice stained with turmeric on the feet, knees, shoulders, and head of
the bridegroom. This is done three times, and five married women then
perform a similar ceremony on the bride. The bridegroom takes up the
t&#257;li, and, with the sanction of the assembled B&#275;dars, ties it
on the bride&rsquo;s neck. In some places it is handed to a
Br&#257;hman priest, who ties it instead of the bridegroom. The
unanimous consent of those present is necessary before the
t&#257;li-tying is proceeded with. The marriage ceremony among the
&#362;ru B&#275;dars is generally performed at the bride&rsquo;s house,
whither the bridegroom and his party proceed on the eve of the wedding.
A feast, called thuppath&#363;ta or gh&#299; (clarified butter) feast,
is held, towards which the bridegroom&rsquo;s parents contribute rice,
cocoanuts, betel leaves and nuts, and make a present of five bodices
(r&#257;vike). At the conclusion of the feast, all assemble beneath the
marriage pandal (booth), and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href=
"#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>betel is distributed in a
recognised order of precedence, commencing with the guru and the god.
On the following morning four big pots, smeared with turmeric and
chunam (lime) are placed in four corners, so as to have a square space
(ir&#257;ni square) between them. Nine turns of cotton thread are wound
round the pots. Within the square the bridegroom and two young girls
seat themselves. Rice is thrown over them, and they are anointed. They
and the bride are then washed by five women called
bh&#363;math&#333;ru. The bridegroom and one of the girls are carried
in procession to the temple, followed by the five women, one of whom
carries a brass vessel with five betel leaves and a ball of sacred
ashes (vib&#363;thi) over its mouth, and another a woman&rsquo;s cloth
on a metal dish, while the remaining three women and the
bridegroom&rsquo;s parents throw rice. Cocoanuts and betel are offered
to Hanum&#257;n, and lines are drawn on the face of the bridegroom with
the sacred ashes. The party then return to the house. The lower half of
a grinding mill is placed beneath the pandal, and a Br&#257;hman priest
invites the contracting couple to stand thereon. He then takes the
t&#257;li, and ties it on the bride&rsquo;s neck, after it has been
touched by the bridegroom. Towards evening the newly married couple sit
inside the house, and close to them is placed a big brass vessel
containing a mixture of cooked rice, jaggery (crude sugar) and curds,
which is brought by the women already referred to. They give a small
quantity thereof to the couple, and go away. Five B&#275;dar men come
near the vessel after removing their head-dress, surround the vessel,
and place their left hands thereon. With their right hands they shovel
the food into their mouths, and bolt it with all possible despatch.
This ceremony is called bh&#363;ma idothu, or special eating, and is in
some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>places performed by both men and women. All
those present watch them eating, and, if any one chokes while devouring
the food, or falls ill within a few months, it is believed to indicate
that the bride has been guilty of irregular behaviour. On the following
day the contracting couple go through the streets, accompanied by
B&#275;dars, the brass vessel and female cloth, and red powder is
scattered broadcast. On the morning of the third and two following
days, the newly married couple sit on a pestle, and are anointed after
rice has been showered over them. The bride&rsquo;s father presents his
son-in-law with a turban, a silver ring, and a cloth. It is said that a
man may marry two sisters, provided that he marries the elder before
the younger.</p>
<p>The following variant of the marriage ceremonies among the
B&#333;yas is given by Mr. Mainwaring. &ldquo;When a B&#333;ya has a
son who should be settled in life, he nominally goes in search of a
bride for him, though it has probably been known for a long time who
the boy is to marry. However, the formality is gone through. The father
of the boy, on arrival at the home of the future bride, explains to her
father the object of his visit. They discuss each other&rsquo;s
families, and, if satisfied that a union would be beneficial to both
families, the father of the girl asks his visitor to call again, on a
day that is agreed to, with some of the village elders. On the
appointed day, the father of the lad collects the elders of his
village, and proceeds with them to the house of the bride-elect. He
carries with him four moottus (sixteen seers) of rice, one seer of dhal
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Cajanus indicus</i>), two seers of gh&#299;
(clarified butter), some betel leaves and areca nuts, a seer of fried
gram, two lumps of jaggery (molasses), five garlic bulbs, five dried
dates, five pieces of turmeric, and a female jacket. In the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>evening, the elders of both sides discuss the
marriage, and, when it is agreed to, the purchase money has to be at
once paid. The cost of a bride is always 101 madas, or Rs. 202. Towards
this sum, sixteen rupees are counted out, and the total is arrived at
by counting areca nuts. The remaining nuts, and articles which were
brought by the party of the bridegroom, are then placed on a brass
tray, and presented to the bride-elect, who is requested to take three
handfuls of nuts and the same quantity of betel leaves. On some
occasions, the betel leaves are omitted. Betel is then distributed to
the assembled persons. The provisions which were brought are next
handed over to the parents of the girl, in addition to two rupees.
These are to enable her father to provide himself with a sheet, as well
as to give a feast to all those who are present at the betrothal. This
is done on the following morning, when both parties breakfast together,
and separate. The wedding is usually fixed for a day a fortnight or a
month after the betrothal ceremony. The ceremony differs but slightly
from that performed by various other castes. A pur&#333;hit is
consulted as to the auspicious hour at which the t&#257;li or bottu
should be tied. This having been settled, the bridegroom goes, on the
day fixed, to the bride&rsquo;s village, or sometimes the bride goes to
the village of the bridegroom. Supposing the bridegroom to be the
visitor, the bride&rsquo;s party carries in procession the provisions
which are to form the meal for the bridegroom&rsquo;s party, and this
will be served on the first night. As the auspicious hour approaches,
the bride&rsquo;s party leave her in the house, and go and fetch the
bridegroom, who is brought in procession to the house of the bride. On
arrival, he is made to stand under the pandal which has been erected. A
curtain is tied therein from north to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>south. The bridegroom
then stands on the east of the curtain, and faces west. The bride is
brought from the house, and placed on the west of the curtain, facing
her future husband. The bridegroom then takes up the bottu, which is
generally a black thread with a small gold bead upon it. He shows it to
the assembled people, and asks permission to fasten it on the
bride&rsquo;s neck. The permission is accorded with acclamations. He
then fastens the bottu on the bride&rsquo;s neck, and she, in return,
ties a thread from a black cumbly (blanket), on which a piece of
turmeric has been threaded, round the right wrist of the bridegroom.
After this, the bridegroom takes some seed, and places it in the
bride&rsquo;s hand. He then puts some pepper-corns with the seed, and
forms his hands into a cup over those of the bride. Her father then
pours milk into his hand, and the bridegroom, holding it, swears to be
faithful to his wife until death. After he has taken the oath, he
allows the milk to trickle through into the hands of the bride. She
receives it, and lets it drop into a vessel placed on the ground
between them. This is done three times, and the oath is repeated with
each performance. Then the bride goes through the same ceremony,
swearing on each occasion to be true to her husband until death. This
done, both wipe their hands on some rice, which is placed close at hand
on brass trays. In each of these trays there must be five seers of
rice, five pieces of turmeric, five bulbs of garlic, a lump of jaggery,
five areca nuts, and five dried dates. When their hands are dry, the
bridegroom takes as much of the rice as he can in his hands, and pours
it over the bride&rsquo;s head. He does this three times, before
submitting to a similar operation at the hands of the bride. Then each
takes a tray, and upsets the contents over the other. At this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>stage, the curtain is removed, and, the pair
standing side by side, their cloths are knotted together. The knot is
called the knot of Brahma, and signifies that it is Brahma who has tied
them together. They now walk out of the pandal, and make obeisance to
the sun by bowing, and placing their hands together before their
breasts in the reverential position of prayer. Returning to the pandal,
they go to one corner of it, where five new and gaudily painted
earthenware pots filled with water have been previously arranged. Into
one of these pots, one of the females present drops a gold nose
ornament, or a man drops a ring. The bride and bridegroom put their
right hands into the pot, and search for the article. Whichever first
finds it takes it out, and, showing it, declares that he or she has
found it. This farce is repeated three times, and the couple then take
their seats on a cumbly in the centre of the pandal, and await the
preparation of the great feast which closes the ceremony. For this, two
sheep are killed, and the friends and relations who have attended are
given as much curry and rice as they can eat. Next morning, the couple
go to the bridegroom&rsquo;s village, or, if the wedding took place at
his village, to that of the bride, and stay there three days before
returning to the marriage pandal. Near the five water-pots already
mentioned, some white-ant earth has been spread at the time of the
wedding, and on this some paddy (unhusked rice) and dhal seeds have
been scattered on the evening of the day on which the wedding
commenced. By the time the couple return, these seeds have sprouted. A
procession is formed, and the seedlings, being gathered up by the newly
married couple, are carried to the village well, into which they are
thrown. This ends the marriage ceremony. At their weddings, the
B&#333;yas indulge in much music. Their dresses are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>gaudy, and suitable to the occasion. The
bridegroom, if he belongs to either of the superior g&#333;tras,
carries a dagger or sword placed in his cummerbund (loin-band). A song
which is frequently sung at weddings is known as the song of the seven
virgins. The presence of a Basavi at a wedding is looked on as a good
omen for the bride, since a Basavi can never become a widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In some places, a branch of <i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus religiosa</i>
or <i>Ficus bengalensis</i> is planted in front of the house as the
marriage milk-post. If it withers, it is thrown away, but, if it takes
root, it is reared. By some B&#275;dars a vessel is filled with milk,
and into it a headman throws the nose ornament of a married woman,
which is searched for by the bride and bridegroom three times. The milk
is then poured into a pit, which is closed up. In the North Arcot
Manual it is stated that the B&#333;ya bride, &ldquo;besides having a
golden t&#257;li tied to her neck, has an iron ring fastened to her
wrist with black string, and the bridegroom has the same. Widows may
not remarry or wear black bangles, but they wear silver
ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Divorce,&rdquo; Mr. Mainwaring writes, &ldquo;is permitted.
Grounds for divorce would be adultery and ill-treatment. The case would
be decided by a panch&#257;yat (council). A divorced woman is treated
as a widow. The remarriage of widows is not permitted, but there is
nothing to prevent a widow keeping house for a man, and begetting
children by him. The couple would announce their intention of living
together by giving a feast to the caste. If this formality was omitted,
they would be regarded as outcastes till it was complied with. The
offspring of such unions are considered illegitimate, and they are not
taken or given in marriage to legitimate children. Here we come to
further social distinctions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=

<p>The Swajathee Sumpradayam should only marry among themselves.
Koodakonna Sumpradayam and Vithunthu Sumpradayam may marry among
themselves, or with each other. Both being considered illegitimate,
they cannot marry Swajathee Sumpradayam, and would not marry
Arsumpradayam, as these are not true B&#333;yas, and are nominally
outcastes, who must marry among themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the occasion of a death among the &#362;ru B&#275;dars of Hospet,
the corpse is carried on a bier by &#362;ru B&#275;dars to the
burial-ground, with a new cloth thrown over, and flowers strewn
thereon. The sons of the deceased each place a quarter-anna in the
mouth of the corpse, and pour water near the grave. After it has been
laid therein, all the agnates throw earth into it, and it is filled in
and covered over with a mound, on to the head end of which five
quarter-anna pieces are thrown. The eldest son, or a near relation,
takes up a pot filled with water, and stands at the head of the grave,
facing west. A hole is made in the pot, and, after going thrice round
the grave, he throws away the pot behind him, and goes home without
looking back. This ceremony is called thelagolu, and, if a person dies
without any heir, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href=
"#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>individual who performs it
succeeds to such property as there may be. On the third day the mound
is smoothed down, and three stones are placed over the head, abdomen,
and legs of the corpse, and whitewashed. A woman brings some luxuries
in the way of food, which are mixed up in a winnowing tray divided into
three portions, and placed in the front of the stones for crows to
partake of. Kites and other animals are driven away, if they attempt to
steal the food. On the ninth day, the divasa (the day) ceremony is
performed. At the spot where the deceased died is placed a decorated
brass vessel representing the soul of the departed, with five betel
leaves and a ball of sacred ashes over its mouth. Close to it a lamp is
placed, and a sheep is killed. Two or three days afterwards, rice and
vegetables are cooked. Those who have been branded carry their gods,
represented by the cylindrical bamboo basket and stick already referred
to, to a stream, wash them therein, and do worship. On their return
home, the food is offered to their gods, and served first to the
D&#257;sari, and then to the others, who must not eat till they have
received permission from the D&#257;sari. When a My&#257;sa B&#275;dar,
who has been branded, dies his basket and stick are thrown into the
grave with the corpse.</p>
<p>In the Mysore Census Report, 1891, the Mysore B&#275;dars are said
to cremate the dead, and on the following day to scatter the ashes on
five tang&#275;du (<i lang="la-x-bio">Cassia auriculata</i>) trees.</p>
<p>It is noted by Buchanan<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11106src" href=
"#xd21e11106" name="xd21e11106src">51</a> that the spirits of Baydaru
men who die without having married become V&#299;rika (heroes), and to
their memory have small temples and images erected, where offerings of
cloth, rice, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209"
name="pb209">209</a>]</span>like, are made to their names. If this be
neglected, they appear in dreams, and threaten those who are forgetful
of their duty. These temples consist of a heap or cairn of stones, in
which the roof of a small cavity is supported by two or three flags;
and the image is a rude shapeless stone, which is occasionally oiled,
as in this country all other images are.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>B&#275;p&#257;ri.&mdash;</b>B&#275;p&#257;ri is, in the Madras
Census Report, described as &ldquo;a caste allied to the Lamb&#257;dis.
Its members worship a female deity called Banj&#257;ra, speak the
B&#275;p&#257;ri or Lamb&#257;di language, and claim to be
Kshatriyas.&rdquo; Bhonjo, the title of the R&#257;j&#257;h of
Gums&#363;r, was returned as a sub-caste. The Rev. G. Gloyer<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11217src" href="#xd21e11217" name=
"xd21e11217src">54</a> correctly makes the name Boipari synonymous with
Brinj&#257;ri, and his illustration of a Boipari family represents
typical Lamb&#257;dis or Brinj&#257;ris. B&#275;p&#257;ri and Boipari
are forms of Vyap&#257;ri or V&#275;p&#257;ri, meaning a trader. The
B&#275;p&#257;ris are traders and carriers between the hills and plains
in the Vizagapatam Agency tracts. Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao informs me that
&ldquo;they regard themselves as immune from the attacks of tigers, if
they take certain precautions. Most of them have to pass through places
infested with these beasts, and their favourite method of keeping them
off is as follows. As soon as they encamp at a place, they level a
square bit of ground, and light fires in the middle of it, round which
they pass the night. It is their firm belief that the tiger will not
enter the square, from fear lest it should become blind, and eventually
be shot. I was once travelling towards Malkangiri from Jeypore, when I
fell in with a party of these people encamped in the manner described.
At that time, several villages about Malkangiri were being ravaged by a
notorious man-eater (tiger).&rdquo;</p>

Vakkaligas, among whom the custom of sacrificing some of the fingers
used to prevail. (<i>See</i> Morasu.)</p>
<p><b>B&#275;ri Chetti.&mdash;</b>The B&#275;ri Chettis, or principal
merchants, like other Chettis and K&#333;matis, claim to be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>Vaisyas, &ldquo;but they will not admit that the
K&#333;matis are on a par with them, and declare that they alone
represent the true Vaisya stock.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"n298.asrc" href="#n298.a" name="n298.asrc">55</a> With regard to their
origin, the Kanyakapur&#257;na states that a certain king wanted to
marry a beautiful maiden of the K&#333;mati caste. When the
K&#333;matis declined to agree to the match, the king began to
persecute them, and those K&#333;matis who left the country out of fear
were called B&#275;ri or Bediri (fear) Chettis. The story is, in fact,
similar to that told by the N&#257;ttuk&#333;ttai Chettis, and the
legend, no doubt, refers to persecution of some king, whose extortion
went beyond the limits of custom. Another derivation of the word
B&#275;ri is from perumai, greatness or splendour. The name B&#275;ri,
as applied to a sub-division of the K&#333;matis, is said to be a
corruption of bedari, and to denote those who fled through fear, and
did not enter the fire-pits with the caste goddess Kanyakamma.</p>
<p>The legend of the B&#275;ri Chettis, as given by Mr. H. A.
Stuart,<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n298.a">55</a> states that
&ldquo;K&#257;v&#275;ripuram near Kumbak&#333;nam was formerly the town
in which the caste principally resided. The king of the country
attempted to obtain a B&#275;ri Chetti maiden in marriage, but was
refused, and he therefore persecuted them, and drove them out of his
dominions, forbidding interchange of meals between them and any other
caste whatever&mdash;a prohibition which is still in force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The B&#275;ri Chettis have a number of endogamous divisions, named
after geographical areas, towns, etc., such as Tirutaniyar,
Acharap&#257;kaththar, Telungu, P&#257;kkam, Musalp&#257;kam. Among
these there is an order of social precedence, some of the divisions
interdining, others not. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href=

<p>The B&#275;ri Chettis are, like the Kamm&#257;lans (artisan class),
a leading caste of the left-hand section, and the following story is
narrated. While the B&#275;ris were living at K&#257;v&#275;ripuram in
a thousand houses, each house bearing a distinct g&#333;tra (house
name,) a king, who took wives from among all castes, wanted the
B&#275;ris to give him one of their maidens. Though unwilling, they
promised to do so, but made up their minds to get over the difficulty
by a ruse. On the day fixed for the marriage, all the B&#275;ri
families left the place, after a male black dog had been tied to the
milk-post of the marriage pandal (booth). When he learnt what had
occurred, the king was very angry, and forbade all castes to take water
from the B&#275;ris. And this led to their joining the left-hand
section.</p>
<p>The B&#275;ri Chettis resort to the panch&#257;yat system of
administration of affairs affecting the caste, and the headman, called
Peridanakk&#257;ran, is assisted by a barber of the left-hand section.
They are in favour of infant marriages, though adult marriage is not
prohibited. They are not allowed to tie plantain trees to the posts of
the wedding pandal, with the trees touching the ground. If this is
done, the Paraiyans, who belong to the right-hand section, cut them
down. This custom is still observed in some out-of-the way villages.
Upan&#257;yanam, or investiture with the sacred thread, is either
performed long before marriage, or by some along with the marriage
rite. A man or boy, after investiture, always wears the thread.</p>
<p>Most of the B&#275;ri Chettis are meat-eaters, but some profess to
be vegetarians.</p>
<p>It is said that there is much dispute between the B&#275;ri Chettis
and the K&#333;matis regarding their relative positions, and each caste
delights to tell stories to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href=
"#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>the detriment of the other. In
general estimation, however, the B&#275;ris are deemed a little
inferior to the K&#333;matis.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11255src" href="#xd21e11255" name="xd21e11255src">56</a> The
claim of the B&#275;ri Chettis to be Vaisyas is based on the following
legend, as given by Mr. Stuart.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11258src"
href="#xd21e11258" name="xd21e11258src">57</a> &ldquo;In the time of
the Ch&#333;las, they erected a water-pandal, and K&#333;matis claimed
the right to use it, which was at once denied. The king attempted to
solve the question by reference to inscriptions in the
K&#257;m&#257;kshiamma temple at Conjeeveram, but without success. He
then proposed that the rivals should submit to the ordeal of carrying
water in an unbaked pot. This was agreed to, and the B&#275;ri Chettis
were alone successful. The penalty for failure was a fine of Rs.
12,000, which the K&#333;matis could not pay, and they were therefore
obliged to enslave themselves to a B&#275;ri Chetti woman, who paid the
fine. Their descendants are still marked men, who depend upon B&#275;ri
Chettis for their subsistence. The great body of the K&#333;matis in
the country were not parties to the agreement, and they do not now
admit that their inferiority has ever been proved.&rdquo; According to
another version of the legend, during the reign of the Ch&#333;las, a
water-pandal was erected by the B&#275;ris, and the K&#333;matis
claimed the right to use it. This was refused on the ground that they
were not Vaisyas. The question at issue was referred to the king, who
promised to enquire into it, but did not do so. A V&#299;ramushti
(caste beggar of the B&#275;ri Chettis and K&#333;matis) killed the
king&rsquo;s horse and elephant. When questioned as to his reason for
so doing, he explained that it was to call the king&rsquo;s attention
to the dispute, and restored the animals to life. The king then
referred both parties to Conjeeveram, where a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>s&#257;sanam (copper-plate grant) was believed
to exist. To procure this document, the decapitation of twelve human
beings was necessary, and the V&#299;ramushti sacrificed his twelve
children. According to the document, the B&#275;ris were Vaisyas, and
the K&#333;matis were ordered to be beheaded. But some B&#275;ris
interceded on their behalf, and they were pardoned on condition that
they would pay a sum of money. To secure the necessary money, they
became slaves to a rich B&#275;ri woman. Ever since this incident, the
K&#333;matis have been the children of the B&#275;ris, and their
descendants are called Pillaip&#363;ntha K&#333;mati, or K&#333;mati
who became a son. For the services which he rendered, the
V&#299;ramushti is said to have been presented with a s&#257;sanam, and
he is treated as a son by the caste men, among whom he has some
influence. For example, the B&#275;ri Chettis may not plant in their
back-yards <i>Moringa pterygosperma</i>, <i>Dolichos Lablab</i>, or a
red variety of <i>Amarantus</i>. If the V&#299;ramushti found the first
of these planted, he would destroy it, and demand a fine of three
fanams. For <i>Dolichos</i> the fine is six fanams, and for
<i>Amarantus</i> one fanam. The rearing of pigs, goats, and fowls by
the B&#275;ri Chettis is forbidden under penalty of a fine. If a
B&#275;ri Chetti woman carries a water-pot on her head, the
V&#299;ramushti will throw it down, and demand a fine of twelve fanams.
The women are not allowed to carry on sales at a public fair, under
penalty of excommunication. The B&#275;ri Chettis and K&#333;matis
should not do business together.</p>
<p>The Kamm&#257;lans and Chettis are regarded as friends, and there is
a Tamil proverb &ldquo;Settiyum Kamm&#257;lanum onnu,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, the Chetti and Kamm&#257;lan are one. In this connection
the following legend is quoted. &ldquo;In the town of Kanda, anciently
the Camalas (artificers of five sorts) lived closely united together,
and were employed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216"
name="pb216">216</a>]</span>by all ranks of men, as there were no
artificers besides them. They feared and respected no king, which
offended certain kings, who combined against them, taking with them all
kinds of arms. But, as the fort (Kanda K&#333;ttai, or magnetic fort),
in which the Camalar lived, was entirely constructed of loadstone, this
attracted, and drew the weapons away from the hands of the assailants.
The kings then promised a great reward to any one who should burn down
the fort. No one dared to do this. At length the courtesans of a temple
engaged to effect it, and took the pledge of betel and areca, engaging
thereby to do so. The kings, greatly rejoicing, built a fort opposite,
filled with such kind of courtesans, who, by their singing, attracted
the people from the fort, and led to intercourse. One of these at
length succeeded in extracting from a young man the secret, that, if
the fort was surrounded with varacu straw, set on fire, it might be
destroyed. The king accordingly had this done, and, in the burning down
of the fort, many of the Camalar lost their lives. Some took to ships
belonging to them, and escaped by sea. In consequence, there were no
artificers in that country. Those taken in the act of endeavouring to
escape were beheaded. One woman of the tribe, being pregnant, took
refuge in the house of a Chetti, and escaped, passing for his daughter.
From a want of artificers, who made implements for weavers, husbandmen,
and the like, manufactures and agriculture ceased, and great discontent
arose in the country. The king, being of clever wit, resorted to a
device to discover if any of the tribe remained, to remedy the evil
complained of. This was to send a piece of coral, having a fine
tortuous aperture running through it, and a piece of thread, to all
parts of the country, with promise of great reward to any one who
should succeed in passing the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217"
href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>thread through the coral.
None could accomplish it. At length the child that had been born in the
Chetty&rsquo;s house undertook to do it; and, to effect it, he placed
the coral over the mouth of an ant-hole, and having steeped the thread
in sugar, placed it at some little distance. The ants took the thread,
and drew it through the coral. The king, seeing the difficulty
overcome, gave great presents, and sent much work to be done, which
that child, under the council and guidance of its mother, performed.
The king sent for the Chetty, and demanded an account of this young
man, which the Chetty detailed. The king had him plentifully supplied
with the means especially of making ploughshares, and, having married
him to the daughter of a Chetty, gave him grants of land for his
maintenance. He had five sons, who followed the five different branches
of work of the Camalar tribe. The king gave them the title of
P&#257;nchalar. Down to the present day there is an intimate relation
between these five branches, and they intermarry with each other;
while, as descendants of the Chetty tribe, they wear the
p&#363;n&#363;l, or caste-thread of that tribe.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11289src" href="#xd21e11289" name=
"xd21e11289src">58</a></p>
<p>The Acharap&#257;kam Chettis are known as Maligh&#275; Chettis, and
are connected with the Chettis of this legend. Even now, in the city of
Madras, when the B&#275;ri Chettis assemble for the transaction of
caste business, the notice summoning the meeting excludes the
Maligh&#275; Chettis, who cannot, like other B&#275;ri Chettis, vote at
elections, meetings, etc., of the Kandas&#257;mi temple.</p>
<p>Some B&#275;ri Chettis, Mr. Stuart writes, &ldquo;worship Siva, and
some Vishnu, and a few are Ling&#257;yats, who do not marry into
families with a different worship. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>bury, while the
others burn their dead. All the divisions wear the sacred thread, and
do not tolerate widow remarriage. Unlike K&#333;matis, their daughters
are sometimes married after puberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Berike.&mdash;</b>The children of a B&#333;ya widow by a man of
her own caste, with whom she lives, are said<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11302src" href="#xd21e11302" name="xd21e11302src">59</a> to drift
into a distinct section called Berike.</p>
<p><b>Bestha.&mdash;</b>The Besthas are summed up, in the Madras Census
Report, 1891, as &ldquo;a Telugu caste, the hereditary occupation of
which is hunting and fishing, but they have largely taken to
agriculture, and the professions of bearers and cooks.&rdquo; In the
Census Report, 1901, it is stated that &ldquo;the fisherman caste in
the Deccan districts are called Besthas and Kabb&#275;ras, while those
in some parts of the Coimbatore and Salem districts style themselves
Toreyar, Siviyar, and Pariv&#257;rattar. These three last speak
Canarese like the Kabb&#275;ras, and seem to be the same as Besthas or
Kabb&#275;ras. Kabb&#275;ra and Toreya have, however, been treated as
distinct castes. There are two endogamous sub-divisions in the Bestha
caste, namely the Telaga and the Parigirti. Some say that the Kabbili
or Kabb&#275;rav&#257;ndlu are a third. The Parigirti section trace
their descent from S&#363;tudu, the famous expounder of the
M&#257;h&#257;bh&#257;rata. Besthas employ Br&#257;hmans and
S&#257;t&#257;nis (or Jangams, if Saivites) for their domestic
ceremonies, and imitate the Br&#257;hman customs, prohibiting widow
remarriage, and worshipping Siva and Vishnu as well as the village
deities. The Maddi sub-caste is said to be called so, because they dye
cotton with the bark of the maddi tree (<i lang="la-x-bio">Morinda
citrifolia</i>).&rdquo; It is suggested, in the Gazetteer of the
Bellary district, that the Besthas are really a sub-division of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>Gangimakkalu Kabb&#275;ras, who were originally
palanquin-bearers, but, now that these vehicles have gone out of
fashion, are employed in divers other ways. It may be noted that the
Siviyars of Coimbatore say that they are Besthas who emigrated from
Mysore in the troublous times of the Muhammadan usurpation. The name
Siviyar, they say, was given to them by the Tamils, as, being strong
and poor, they were palanquin-bearers to officers on circuit and others
in the pre-railway days. Their main occupations at the present day are
tank and river fishing.</p>
<p>In the Manual of the North Arcot district, it is noted that many
Besthas &ldquo;trade, and are in a flourishing condition, being most
numerous above the gh&#257;ts. The name Bestha appears to have no
meaning, but they call themselves S&#363;takulam, and say they are
descendants of the rishi S&#363;ta Mah&#257;muni. The term S&#363;ta
also applies to the offspring of a Kshatriya by a Br&#257;hman, but it
seems more probable that the Besthas gained the name from their
superiority in the culinary art, s&#363;ta also meaning cook. They are
divided into Telugu Besthas and Parigirti Besthas, the difference
between them being chiefly one of religious observance, the former
being in the habit of getting themselves branded on the shoulders with
the Vaishnavite emblems&mdash;chank and chakram&mdash;and the latter
never undergoing this ceremony. It is a rule with them to employ
D&#257;saris as the messengers of a death, and Ts&#257;kalas, as those
of a birth, or of the fact that a girl has reached womanhood. Their
chief object of worship is Hanum&#257;n, the monkey god, a picture or
figure of whom they always have in their houses for domestic
worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with the names Parigirti or Pakirithi which have been
recorded as divisions of the Besthas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>it may be observed
that, in some parts of the Telugu country, the term Pakirithi is used
as a substitute for Vaishnava. This word has become converted into
Parigirti or Parikithi, denoting that the Besthas are Vaishnavites, as
opposed to Saivites. Some Besthas, when questioned as to the origin of
their caste, said that they had no purandam to help them. The word used
by them is a corruption of pur&#257;nam.</p>
<p>The Besthas are summed up, in the Mysore Census Report, 1901, as
&ldquo;fishermen, boatmen, and palanquin-bearers, who are known by
different names according to the localities they live in. In the
eastern districts they are called Bestha, in the southern Toraya,
Ambiga and Parivara (boatmen), while in the western parts their names
are Kabyara and Gangemakkalu. The Telugu-speaking population call
themselves Boyis. Their chief occupations are fishing,
palanquin-bearing, and lime-burning. Some of them are employed by
Government as peons (orderlies), etc., while a large number are engaged
in agricultural pursuits. The Boyis obey a headman called the Pedda
(big) Boyi. The Toraya does not intermarry either with the Kabyara or
the Boyi, whom he resembles in every way. The Kabyara or Karnatic
Besthas proper never carry the palanquin, but live by either farming or
lime-burning. They have a headman known as the Yajaman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have often seen Besthas in Mysore fishing on tanks from rafts,
with floats made of cane or cork-wood supporting their fish-baskets.
The Besthas use small cast-nets, and it is thought by them that the
employment of drag-nets worked by several men would bring bad luck to
them. When a new net is used for the first time, the first fish which
is caught is cut, and the net smeared with its blood. One of the meshes
of the net <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>is burnt, after incense has been thrown into the
fire. If a snake becomes entangled in a net when it is first used, it
is rejected, and burnt or otherwise disposed of.</p>
<p>The tribal deity of the Telugu Besthas is K&#257;mamma, and, when
this goddess is worshipped, M&#257;la Pambalas are engaged to recite
the legendary story relating to her. They never offer the flesh of
animals or liquor to the goddess.</p>
<p>Like other Telugu castes, the Besthas have intip&#275;rulu or
exogamous septs and g&#333;tras. In connection with some of the latter,
certain prohibitions are observed. For example, the jasmine plant
(mall&#275;) may not be touched by members of the mall&#275;
g&#333;tra, and the ippa tree (<i lang="la-x-bio">Bassia latifolia</i>)
may not be touched or used by members of the Ippala g&#333;tra. Writing
at the beginning of the last century, Buchanan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11334src" href="#xd21e11334" name="xd21e11334src">60</a> informs
us that &ldquo;everywhere in Karnata the palanquin-bearers are of
Telinga descent. In the language of Karnata they are called Teliga
Besthas, but in their own dialect they are called Bai. Their proper
occupations, beside that of carrying the palanquin, are fishing, and
distillation of rum. Wealthy men among them become farmers, but none of
the caste hire themselves out as farm servants. Their hereditary chiefs
are called Pedde Bui, which, among the Europeans of Madras, is bestowed
on the headman of every gentleman&rsquo;s set.&rdquo; In a note on the
Bestha B&#333;yis, or fishermen bearers of Masulipatam in the days of
the East India Company, Mr. H. G. Prendergast writes<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e11337src" href="#xd21e11337" name="xd21e11337src">61</a> that
they were &ldquo;found to be peculiarly trustworthy servants. When
their English masters went on promotion to Madras, they were
accompanied by their trusty B&#333;yis, and, from that day to this,
Bestha <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>B&#333;yis have been employed as attendants in
public and mercantile offices in Madras, and have continued to maintain
their good reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the use of the word Boy (a corruption of B&#333;yi) for
palanquin-bearer, numerous examples are quoted by Yule and
Burnell.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11344src" href="#xd21e11344" name=
"xd21e11344src">62</a> Thus Carraccioli, in his life of Lord Clive,
records that, in 1785, the Boys with Colonel Lawrence&rsquo;s
palankeen, having struggled a little out of the time of march, were
picked up by the Marattas. Writing in 1563, Barras states<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e11347src" href="#xd21e11347" name=
"xd21e11347src">63</a> that &ldquo;there are men who carry the umbrella
so dexterously to ward off the sun that, although their master trots on
his horse, the sun does not touch any part of his body and such men are
called Boi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The insigne of the Besthas, as recorded at Conjeeveram, is a
net.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11352src" href="#xd21e11352" name=

vigorous, enterprising, thrifty, subtle and unscrupulous. Some of the
richest men in Bombay started life without a penny. A large number of
Bh&#257;tias are merchant traders and brokers, and within the last
fifty years they have become a very wealthy and important class.&rdquo;

<p><b>Bhatr&#257;zu.&mdash;</b>The Bh&#257;ts, Bhatr&#257;zus, or
Bhatr&#257;jus are described, in the Mysore Census Reports, 1891 and
1901, as musicians and ballad-reciters, who &ldquo;speak Telugu, and
are supposed to have come from the Northern Circars. They were
originally attached to the courts of the Hindu princes as bards or
professional <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>troubadours, reciting ballads in poetry in
glorification of the wondrous deeds of local princes and heroes. Hyder
Ali, although not a Hindu, delighted to be constantly preceded by them,
and they are still an appendage to the state of Hindu and Mussalman
Chiefs. They have a wonderful faculty in speaking <i>improvisatore</i>,
on any subject proposed to them, a declamation in measures, which may
be considered as a sort of medium between blank verse and modulated
verse. But their profession is that of chanting the exploits of former
days in front of the troops while marshalling them for battle, and
inciting them to emulate the glory of their ancestors. Now many of them
are mendicants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1871, the Bhat R&#257;jahs are said to
&ldquo;wear the pavitra or sacred thread. They are the bards and
minstrels, who sing the praises of the Kshatriya race, or indeed of
great men in general, and especially of those who liberally reward the
singers. They are a wandering class, gaining a living by attaching
themselves to the establishments of great men, or in chanting the
folklore of the people. They are mostly Vishnu worshippers, and in only
one district is it reported that they worship village deities.&rdquo;
In the Madras Census Report, 1891, the Bhatr&#257;zus are summed up as
being &ldquo;a class of professional bards, spread all over the Telugu
districts. They are the representatives of the Bh&#257;t caste of other
parts of India. They are called R&#257;zus, because they are supposed
to be the offspring of a Kshatriya female by a Vaisya male. They are
well versed in folklore, and in the family histories and legends of the
ancient R&#257;jahs. Under the old Hindu R&#257;jahs the Bhatr&#257;zus
were employed as bards, eulogists, and reciters of family genealogy and
tradition. Most of them are now cultivators, and only a few are
ballad-reciters. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225"
name="pb225">225</a>]</span>They will eat with the K&#257;pus and
Velamas. Their ceremonies of birth, death and marriage are more or less
the same as those of the K&#257;pus. R&#257;zu is the general name of
the caste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bhatr&#257;zus, Mr. W. Francis writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11431src" href="#xd21e11431" name="xd21e11431src">65</a>
&ldquo;are also called Bh&#257;ts or M&#257;gadas. They have two
endogamous sub-divisions, called Vandi, R&#257;ja or Telag&#257;nya,
and M&#257;gada, Kani or Agrah&#257;rekala. [Some Bhatr&#257;zus
maintain that Vandi and M&#257;gada were individuals who officiated as
heralds at the marriage of Siva.] Each of these is again split up into
several exogamous septs or g&#333;tras, among which are Atr&#275;ya,
Bh&#257;radw&#257;ja, Gautama, K&#257;syapa and Kaundinya. All of these
are Br&#257;hmanical g&#333;tras, which goes to confirm the story in
Manu that the caste is the offspring of a Vaisya father and a Kshatriya
mother. Bhatr&#257;zus nevertheless do not all wear the sacred thread
now-a-days, or recite the g&#257;yatri.<a class="noteref" id=

employ Br&#257;hman priests for their marriages, but Jangams and
S&#257;t&#257;nis for funerals, and in all these ceremonies they follow
the lower or Pur&#257;nic instead of the higher V&#275;dic ritual.
Widow marriage is strictly forbidden, but yet they eat fish, mutton and
pork, though not beef. These contradictions are, however, common among
Oriya castes, and the tradition is that the Bhatr&#257;zus were a
northern caste which was first invited south by King Prat&#257;pa
R&#363;dra of the Kshatriya dynasty of W&#257;rangal (1295&ndash;1323
A.D.). After the downfall of that kingdom they seem to have become
court bards and panegyrists under the Reddi and Velama feudal chiefs,
who had by that time carved out for themselves small independent
principalities in the Telugu country. As a class they were fairly
educated in the Telugu <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href=
"#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>literature, and even produced
poets such as R&#257;mar&#257;ja Bh&#363;shana, the author of the
well-known Vasu-Charitram. Their usual title is Bhat, sometimes with
the affix R&#257;zu or M&#363;rti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the Bhatr&#257;zus in the North Arcot district, Mr. H. A. Stuart
states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11441src" href="#xd21e11441" name=
"xd21e11441src">67</a> that &ldquo;they now live by cultivation, and by
singing the fabulous traditions current regarding the different
S&#363;dra castes at their marriages and other ceremonies, having
probably invented most of them. They profess to be Kshatriyas. But it
is known that several are Musalmans or members of other castes, who,
possessing an aptitude for extempore versification, were taken by
R&#257;jahs to sing their praises, and so called themselves
Bhattur&#257;zus. They resemble the R&#257;zus in their customs, but
are said to bury their dead.&rdquo; In the Gazetteer of Anantapur, the
Bhatr&#257;zus are described as touring round the villages, making
extempore verses in praise of the principal householders, and being
rewarded by gifts of old clothes, grain, and money. It is stated in the
Kurnool Manual that &ldquo;the high-caste people (Kammas) are bound to
pay the Batr&#257;julu certain fees on marriage occasions. Some of the
Batr&#257;jas have shotriems and in&#257;ms.&rdquo; Shotriem is land
given as a gift for proficiency in the V&#275;das or learning, and
in&#257;m is land given free of rent.</p>
<p>In connection with the special attachment of the Bhatr&#257;zus to
the Velama, Kamma, and K&#257;pu castes, the following story is
narrated. Once upon a time there was a man named Pillala Marri
Beth&#257;la Reddi, who had three sons, of whom two took to
cultivation. The third son adopted a military life, and had
seventy-four sons, all of whom became commanders. On one occasion,
during <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>the reign of Prat&#257;pa R&#363;dra, when they
were staying at the fort of W&#257;rangal, they quarrelled among
themselves, and became very rebellious. On learning this, the king
summoned them to his court. He issued orders that a sword should be
tied across the gate. The commanders were reluctant to go under a
sword, as it would be a sign of humiliation. Some of them ran against
the sword, and killed themselves. A Bhatr&#257;zu, who witnessed this,
promised to help the remaining commanders to gain entrance without
passing under the sword. He went to the king, and said that a
Br&#257;hman wished to pay him a visit. An order was accordingly issued
that the sword should be removed. The services of the Bhatr&#257;zu
greatly pleased the commanders, and they came to regard the
Bhatr&#257;zus as their dependants, and treated them with
consideration. Even at the present day, at a marriage among the
K&#257;pus, Kammas, and Velamas, a Bhatr&#257;zu is engaged. His duties
are to assist the bridegroom in his wedding toilette, to paint
sectarian marks on his forehead, and to remain as his personal
attendant throughout the marriage ceremonies. He further sings stanzas
from the R&#257;mayana or Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata, and songs in praise of
Br&#257;hmans and the caste to which the bridal couple belong. The
following was sung at a K&#257;pu wedding. &ldquo;Anna Vema Reddi piled
up money like a mountain, and, with his brother Pinna Brahma Reddi,
constructed agrah&#257;rams. Gone Buddha Reddi spent large sums of
money for the reading of the R&#257;mayana, and heard it with much
interest. Panta Malla Reddi caused several tanks to be dug. You, their
descendants, are all prosperous, and very charitable.&rdquo; In the
houses of Kammas, the following is recited. &ldquo;Of the seventy-seven
sons, Bobbali Narasanna was a very brave man, and was told to go in
search of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>kamma (an ornament) without using abusive
language. Those who ran away are Velamas, and those who secured it
Kammas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their ceremonial observances, the Bhatr&#257;zus closely follow
the standard Telugu type. At marriages, the bridal couple sit on the
dais on a plank of juvvi (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus Tsiela</i>) wood.
They have the Telugu Janappans as their disciples, and are the only
non-Br&#257;hman caste, except Jangams and Pand&#257;rams, which
performs the duties of guru or religious instructor. The badge of the
Bhatr&#257;zus at Conjeeveram is a silver stick.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11456src" href="#xd21e11456" name="xd21e11456src">68</a></p>
<p>In the Madras Census Report, 1901, Bh&#257;to, Kani R&#257;zu,
Kann&#257;ji Bh&#257;t and Padiga R&#257;ju appear as synonyms, and
Ann&#257;ji Bhat as a sub-caste of Bhatr&#257;zus.</p>
<p>The following account of a criminal class, calling themselves
Battur&#257;jas or Battu Turakas, was published in the Police Weekly
Circular, Madras, in 1881.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11463src" href=
"#xd21e11463" name="xd21e11463src">69</a> &ldquo;They are known to the
Cuddapah and North Arcot Police as criminals, and a note is made
whenever an adult leaves his village; but, as they commit their
depredations far from home, and convert their spoil into hard cash
before they return, it is difficult to get evidence against them. Ten
or twelve of these leave home at once; they usually work in parties of
three or four, and they are frequently absent for months together. They
have methods of communicating intelligence to their associates when
separated from them, but the only one of these methods that is known is
by means of their leaf plates, which they sew in a peculiar manner, and
leave after use in certain places previously agreed upon. These leaf
plates can be recognised by experts, but all that these experts can
learn from them is that Battu Turakas have been in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>the
neighbourhood recently. On their return to their village, an account of
their proceedings is rendered, and their spoil is divided equally among
the whole community, a double share being, however, given to the actual
thief or thieves. They usually disguise themselves as Br&#257;hmans,
and, in the search of some of their houses lately, silk cloths worn
only by Br&#257;hmans were found together with other articles necessary
for the purpose (rudr&#257;ksha necklaces, s&#257;lagr&#257;ma stones,
etc.). They are also instructed in Sanskrit, and in all the outward
requisites of Br&#257;hmanism. A Telugu Br&#257;hman would soon find
out that they are not Br&#257;hmans, and it is on this account that
they confine their depredations to the Tamil country, where allowance
is made for them as rude uncivilized Telugus. They frequent choultries
(travellers&rsquo; resting-places), where their very respectable
appearance disarms suspicion, and watch for opportunities of committing
thefts, substituting their own bags or bundles (filled with rubbish)
for those they carry off.&rdquo; To this account Mr. M. Paupa Rao Naidu
adds<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11470src" href="#xd21e11470" name=
"xd21e11470src">70</a> that &ldquo;it is during festivals and feasts
that they very often commit thefts of the jewels and cloths of persons
bathing in the tanks. They are thus known as Kolamchuthi P&#257;par,
meaning that they are Br&#257;hmins that live by stealing around the
tanks. Before the introduction of railways, their depredations were
mostly confined to the choultries and tanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the Bhattu Turakas of the North Arcot district, Mr. H. A.
Stuart writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11475src" href="#xd21e11475"
name="xd21e11475src">71</a> that &ldquo;a few of this very intelligent
and educated criminal class are found in the north-west of the
Chendragiri t&#257;luk, and in the north of Pungan&#363;r. They are
really Muhammadans, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href=
"#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>never worship according to the
rules of that religion, and know little about its tenets. They have no
employment save cheating, and in this they are incomparably clever.
They speak several languages with perfect fluency, have often studied
Sanskrit, and are able to personate any caste. Having marked down a
well-to-do householder, they take an opportunity of entering his
service, and succeed at last in gaining his confidence. They then abuse
it by absconding with what they can lay hands upon. They often take to
false coining and forgery, pretend to know medicine, to have the power
of making gold or precious stones, or of turning currency notes into
others of higher value.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Bh&#257;yipuo.&mdash;</b>Bh&#257;yipuo is returned, in the Census
Report, 1901, as an Oriya caste, the members of which claim to be
Kshatriyas. The word means brother&rsquo;s son, in which sense it is
applied to the issue of the brothers of R&#257;jahs by concubines. The
illegitimate children of R&#257;jahs are also classed as
Bh&#257;yipuo.</p>
<p><b>Bhima.&mdash;</b>A section of Savaras, named after Bhima, one of
the P&#257;ndava brothers.</p>
<p><b>Bholia</b> (wild dog).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kondra.</p>
<p><b>Bhond&#257;ri.&mdash;</b>The Bhond&#257;ris are the barbers of
the Oriya country, living in Ganjam. &ldquo;The name
Bhond&#257;ri,&rdquo; Mr. S. P. Rice writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11496src" href="#xd21e11496" name="xd21e11496src">72</a> is
&ldquo;derived from bhondaram, treasure. The zamindars delivered over
the guarding of the treasure to the professional barbers, who became a
more important person in this capacity than in his original office of
shaver in ordinary to His Highness.&rdquo; The Bhond&#257;ris occupy a
higher position than the Tamil and Telugu barbers. Though various Oriya
castes bathe after being shaved, the touch of a Bhond&#257;ri at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>other times is not regarded as polluting. All
over the Ganjam district, the Bhond&#257;ris are employed as domestic
servants, and some are engaged as coolies, cart-drivers, etc. Others
officiate as p&#363;j&#257;ris (priests) at Takur&#257;ni (village
deity) temples, grind sandalwood, or make flower garlands. On the
occasion of ceremonial processions, the washing of the feet of the
guests, carrying articles required for worship, and the jewels and
cloths to be worn by the bridal couple on the wedding day, are
performed by the Bhond&#257;ri. I am informed that a woman of this
caste is employed by Karnams on the occasion of marriage and other
ceremonials, at which her services are indispensable. It is said that
in some places, where the Bhond&#257;ris do not shave castes lower than
the Gudiyas, Oriya Br&#257;hmans allow them to remove the leaf plates
off which they have taken their food, though this should not be done by
a non-Br&#257;hman.</p>
<p>There are apparently three endogamous sub-divisions, named
Godomalia, Odisi, and Bejjo. The word Godomalia means a group of forts,
and it is said to be the duty of members of this section to serve
R&#257;jahs who live in forts. The Godomalias are most numerous in
Ganjam, where they claim to be superior to the Odisi and Bejjo
sections. Among exogamous septs, Mohiro (peacock), Dhippo (light),
Oppomarango (<i lang="la-x-bio">Achyranthes aspera</i>), and
N&#257;gasira (cobra) may be noted. Members of the Oppomarango sept do
not touch, or use the root of the plant as a tooth brush. Lights may
not be blown out with the breath, or otherwise extinguished by members
of the Dhippo sept; and they do not light their lamps unless they are
madi, <i>i.e.</i>, wearing silk cloths, or cloths washed and dried
after bathing. N&#257;gasira is a sept common to many Oriya castes, and
is said to owe its origin to the influence of Oriya Br&#257;hmans.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span></p>
<p>The hereditary headman of the caste is called B&#275;hara, and he is
assisted by a Bhollobaya. Most of the Bhond&#257;ris follow the form of
Vaishnavism inculcated by Chaithyana, and known as Paramartho matham.
They wear as a necklace a string of tulsi (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ocimum
sanctum</i>) beads, without which they will not worship or take their
food. Many Hindu deities, especially Jagann&#257;tha, and various local
T&#257;kur&#257;nis are also worshipped by them.</p>
<p>A man should not marry his maternal uncle&rsquo;s or paternal
aunt&rsquo;s daughter. Infant marriage is the rule, and, if a girl has
not secured a husband before she attains maturity, she has to go
through a mock marriage ceremony called dharma bibha. She is taken to a
<i lang="la-x-bio">Streblus asper</i> (sah&#257;da or sh&#257;di) tree,
and married to it. She may not, during the rest of her life, touch the
<i lang="la-x-bio">Streblus</i> tree, or use its twigs as a tooth
brush. Sometimes she goes through the ceremony of marriage with some
elderly man, preferably her grandfather, or, failing him, her elder
sister&rsquo;s husband as bridegroom. A divorce agreement (tsado patro)
is drawn up, and the pseudo-marriage thereby dissolved. Sometimes the
bridegroom is represented by a bow and arrow, and the ceremony is
called khando bibha.</p>
<p>The real marriage ceremonies last over seven days. On the day before
the bibha (wedding), a number of earthen pots are placed on a spot
which has been cleaned for their reception, and some married women
throw <i lang="la-x-bio">Zizyphus Jujuba</i> leaves and rice,
apparently as an evil-eye removing and purificatory ceremony. While
doing so, they cry &ldquo;&#362;lu, ulu&rdquo; in a manner which
recalls to mind the kulavi idal of the Maravans and Kallans. A
ceremony, called sokko bhondo, or wheel worship, is performed to a
potter&rsquo;s wheel. The bridegroom, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>has to fast until the
night, is shaved, after which he stands on a grindstone and bathes.
While he is so doing, some women bring a grinding-mill stone, and grind
to powder <i lang="la-x-bio">Vigna Catiang</i>, <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Cajanus indicus</i> and <i>Cicer arietinum</i> seeds, crying
&ldquo;&#362;lu, ulu,&rdquo; as they do so. The bridegroom then dresses
himself, and sits on the marriage dais, while a number of married women
crowd round him, each of whom touches an areca nut placed on his head
seven times with a grinding stone. They also perform the ceremony
called bhondaivaro, which consists in throwing <i>Zizyphus Jujuba</i>
leaves, and rice dyed with turmeric, over the bridegroom, again calling
out &ldquo;&#362;lu, ulu.&rdquo; Towards evening, the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party proceed in procession to a temple, taking with
them the various articles required on the morrow, such as the sacred
thread, jewels, cloths, and mokkuto (forehead ornament). After
worshipping the god, they return home, and on the way thither collect
water in a vessel from seven houses, to be used by the bridegroom when
he bathes next day. A ceremonial very similar to that performed by the
bridegroom on the eve of the wedding is also performed by the bride and
her party. On the wedding day, the bridegroom, after worshipping
Vign&#275;swara (Gan&#275;sa) at the marriage dais with the assistance
of a Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit, proceeds, dressed up in his marriage
finery, mokkuto, sacred thread and wrist thread, to a temple in a
palanquin, and worships there. Later on, he goes to the bride&rsquo;s
house in a palanquin. Just as he is about to start, his brother&rsquo;s
wife catches hold of the palanquin, and will not let him go till she
has received a present of a new cloth. He is met <i>en route</i> by the
bride&rsquo;s father, and his feet are washed by her brother. His
future father-in-law, after waving seven balls of coloured rice before
him, escorts him to his house. At <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234"
href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>the entrance thereto, a
number of women, including the bride&rsquo;s mother, await his arrival,
and, on his approach, throw <i lang="la-x-bio">Zizyphus Jujuba</i>
leaves, and cry &ldquo;&#362;lu, ulu.&rdquo; His future mother-in-law,
taking him by the hand, leads him into the house. As soon as he has
reached the marriage dais, the bride is conducted thither by her
maternal uncle, and throws some salt over a screen on to the
bridegroom. Later on, she takes her seat by his side, and the
Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit, after doing h&#333;mam (making sacred fire),
ties the hands of the contracting couple together with dharbha grass.
This is called hastagonthi, and is the binding portion of the marriage
ceremony. The bride and bridegroom then exchange ten areca nuts and ten
myrabolams (<i lang="la-x-bio">Terminalia</i> fruits). Two new cloths
are thrown over them, and the ends thereof are tied together in a knot
containing twenty-one cowry (<i lang="la-x-bio">Cypr&aelig;a
Arabica</i>) shells, a coin, and a few <i lang="la-x-bio">Zizyphus</i>
leaves. This ceremonial is called gontiyalo. The bride&rsquo;s brother
strikes the bridegroom with his fist, and receives a present of a
cloth. At this stage, the couple receive presents from relations and
friends. They then play seven times with cowry shells, and the
ceremonial closes with the throwing of <i lang="la-x-bio">Zizyphus</i>
leaves, and the eating by the bride and bridegroom of rice mixed with
jaggery (crude sugar) and curds. On the two following days, they sit on
the dais, play with cowries, and have leaves and rice thrown over them.
They wear the cloths given to them on the wedding day, and may not
bathe in a tank (pond) or river. On the fourth day (chauti), the bride
is received into the g&#333;tra of the bridegroom. In token thereof,
she cooks some food given to her by the bridegroom, and the pair make a
show of partaking thereof. Towards the evening the bride is conducted
by her maternal uncle to near the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235"
href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>dais, and she stands on a
grinding stone. Seven turns of thread dyed with turmeric are wound
round the posts of the dais. Leading his wife thither, the bridegroom
cuts the thread, and the couple stand on the dais, while four persons
support a cloth canopy over their heads, and rice is scattered over
them. On the fifth day, the newly-married couple and their relations
indulge in throwing turmeric water over each other. Early on the
morning of the sixth day, the bridegroom breaks a pot placed on the
dais, and goes away in feigned anger to the house of a relation.
Towards evening, he is brought back by his brother-in-law, and plays at
cowries with the bride. The Bhondaivaro ceremony is once more repeated.
On the seventh day, the sacred thread, wrist-threads and mokkuto are
removed. Widows and divorc&eacute;es are permitted to remarry. As among
various other castes, a widow should marry her deceased husband&rsquo;s
younger brother.</p>
<p>The dead are cremated. When a person is on the point of death, a
little Jagann&#257;tha pras&#257;dam, <i>i.e.</i>, rice from the temple
at Puri, is placed in his mouth. Members of many Oriya castes keep by
them partially cooked rice, called nirm&#257;lyam, brought from this
temple, and a little of this is eaten by the orthodox before meals and
after bathing. The corpse is washed, anointed, and wrapped in a new
cloth. After it has been secured on the bier, a new red cloth is thrown
over it. At the head, a sheaf of straw, from the roof of the house, if
it is thatched, is placed. The funeral pyre is generally prepared by an
Oriya washerman. At the burning-ground, the corpse is placed close to
the pyre, and the son puts into the mouth some parched rice, and throws
rice over the eyes. Then, lighting the straw, he waves it thrice round
the corpse, and throws it on the face. The corpse is then <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>carried thrice round the pyre, and laid thereon.
In the course of cremation, each mourner throws a log on the pyre. The
son goes home, wet and dripping, after bathing. On the following day,
the fire is extinguished, and two fragments of bone are placed in a
small pot, and carefully preserved. The ashes are heaped up, and an
image is drawn on the ground with a stick, to which food is offered. A
meal, called pithapona (bitter food), consisting of rice and margosa
(<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves, is partaken of by agnates only. On
the tenth day, the relatives and intimate friends of the deceased are
shaved, the son last of all. The son and the agnates go to a tank bund
(pond embankment), and cook food in a new pot within a shed which has
been specially constructed for the occasion. The pot is then broken
into ten fragments, on which food is placed, and offered to the dead
person. The son takes the fragments, one by one, to the tank, bathing
each time. The pot containing the two pieces of bone is generally
buried beneath a p&#299;pal (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>) tree growing near
a tank. On the tenth day, after the offering of food, the son proceeds
to this spot, and, after pouring water ten times over the ground
beneath which the pot is buried, takes the pot home, and buries it near
the house. As he approaches his home, he goes ahead of those who
accompany him, and, carrying a vessel filled with water, pours some of
this three times on the ground, waving his hand in a circular manner.
He then makes three marks with a piece of iron on the ground. A piece
of hollow bamboo open at both ends, or other grain measure, is given to
him, with which he measures rice or other grain seven times. He then
throws the measure behind him between his legs, and, entering the
house, puts a sect mark on his forehead with the aid of a broken
looking-glass, which must be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>thrown away. Gh&#299; (clarified
butter) and meat may not be eaten by those under death pollution till
the eleventh day, when a feast is held.</p>
<p>If an important elder of the community dies, a ceremony called
jola-jola handi (pot drilled with holes) is performed on the night of
the tenth day. Fine sand is spread over the floor of a room having two
doors, and the surface is smoothed with a tray or plank. On the sand a
lighted lamp is placed, with an areca nut by its side. The lamp is
covered with an earthen cooking-pot. Two men carry on their shoulders a
pot riddled with holes, suspended from a pole made of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Diospyros Embryopteris</i> wood, from inside the room into
the street, as soon as the lamp is covered by the cooking-pot. Both
doors of the room are then closed, and not opened till the return of
the men. The pot which they carry is believed to increase in weight as
they bear it to a tank, into which it is thrown. On their return to the
house, they tap three times at the door, which then opens. All present
then crowd into the room, and examine the sand for the marks of the
foot-prints of a bull, cat or man, the trail of a centipede,
cart-track, ladder, etc., which are believed to be left by the dead
person when he goes to the other world.</p>
<p>Opprobrious names are very common among the Bhond&#257;ris,
especially if a child is born after a succession of deaths among the
offspring of a family. Very common among such names are those of low
castes, <i>e.g.</i>, Haddi, Bavuria, Dand&#257;si, etc.</p>

<p><b>Bh&#363;mia.&mdash;</b>The Bh&#363;mias are an Oriya caste of
hill cultivators, found in the Jeypore Zamind&#257;ri. According to a
tradition, they were the first to cultivate the land on the hills. In
the Central Provinces they are said to be known as Baigas, concerning
whom Captain Ward writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11625src" href=
"#xd21e11625" name="xd21e11625src">73</a> that &ldquo;the decision of
the Baiga in a boundary dispute is almost always accepted as final,
and, from this right as children of the soil and arbiters of the land
belonging to each village, they are said to have derived their title of
Bh&#363;mia, the Sanskrit bh&#363;mi meaning the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following note I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The
Bh&#363;mias have septs, <i>e.g.</i>, bh&#257;g (tiger) and n&#257;ga
(cobra). A man can claim his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter in
marriage. The marriage ceremonial is much the same as among the
Bottadas. The jholla tonk (presents) consist of liquor, rice, a sheep
or fowl, and cloths for the parents of the bride. A pandal (booth),
made of poles of the sorghi tree, is erected in front of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house, and a D&#275;s&#257;ri officiates. The
remarriage of widows is permitted and a younger brother usually marries
his elder brother&rsquo;s widow. If a man divorces his wife, it is
customary for him to give her a rupee and a new cloth in compensation.
The dead are burned, and pollution lasts for nine days. On the tenth
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=

<p><b>Bilimagga.&mdash;</b>The Bilimagga weavers of South Canara, who
speak a very corrupt form of Tamil, must not be confused with the
Bilimaggas of Mysore, whose mother-tongue is Canarese. In some places
the Bilimaggas of South Canara call themselves Padma S&#257;l&#275;s,
but they have no connection with the Padma S&#257;l&#275; caste. There
is a tradition that they emigrated from P&#257;ndiya Madurad&#275;sa in
the Tamil country. The caste name Bilimagga (white loom) is derived
from the fact that they weave only white cloths. In some places, for
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>same reason, D&#275;v&#257;ngas call themselves
Bilimaggas, but the D&#275;v&#257;ngas also make coloured cloths. White
cloths are required for certain gods and bh&#363;thas (devils) on
occasions of festivals, and these are usually obtained from
Bilimaggas.</p>
<p>The Bilimaggas follow the makkala sant&#257;na law of inheritance
(from father to son). They are said to have seven g&#333;tras, and
those of the Mangalore, Kundap&#363;r, and Udipi t&#257;luks, are
stated to belong respectively to the 800, 700, and 500 nagaras. The
caste deities are V&#299;rabhadra, Brahmalinga, and Ammanoru.</p>
<p>For the whole community, there is a chief headman called Paththukku
Solra Settigar, or the Setti who advises the ten, and for every village
there is an ordinary headman styled Gurik&#257;ra. The chief headman is
usually the manager of some temple of the caste, and the Gurik&#257;ra
has to collect the dues from the members of the community. Every
married couple has to pay an annual tax of twelve annas, and every
unmarried male over twelve years of age of six annas towards the temple
fund.</p>
<p>Marriage of girls before puberty is the rule, and any girl who
attains maturity without being married runs the risk of losing her
caste. The remarriage of widows is permitted. The betrothal ceremony is
important as being binding as a contract. It consists in the father of
the girl giving betel leaves and areca nuts in a tray to the father of
her future husband, before a number of people. If the contract is
dissolved before the marriage is celebrated, betel and nuts must be
presented to the father of the girl, in the presence of an assembly, as
a sign that the engagement is broken off. On the day previous to the
marriage ceremonial, the fathers of the contracting couple exchange
betel leaves and areca nuts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href=
"#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>three times. On the following
morning, they proceed to the house of the bridegroom, the bride&rsquo;s
father carrying a brass vessel containing water. From this vessel,
water is poured into smaller vessels by an odd number of women (five or
more). These women are usually selected by the wife of the headman. The
pouring of the water must be carried out according to a recognised code
of precedence, which varies with the locality. At Udipi, for example,
the order is Mangalore, Bark&#363;r, Udipi. The women all pour water
over the head of the bridegroom.</p>
<p>The rite is called mariy&#257;the n&#299;ru (water for respect). The
bridegroom is then decorated, and a b&#257;shingam (chaplet) is placed
on his forehead. He sits in front of a brass vessel, called Ganapathi
(the elephant god), which is placed on a small quantity of rice spread
on the floor, and worships it. He is then conducted to the marriage
pandal (booth) by his sister&rsquo;s husband, followed by his sister
carrying the brass vessel and a gindi (vessel with a spout), to which
the bride&rsquo;s b&#257;shingam and the t&#257;li (marriage badge) are
tied. A red cloth, intended for the bride, must also be carried by her.
Within the pandal, the bridegroom stands in front of a cot. The
bride&rsquo;s party, and the men in attendance on the bridegroom, stand
opposite each other with the bridegroom between them, and throw rice
over each other. All are then seated, except the bridegroom, his
sister, and the bride&rsquo;s brother. The bridegroom&rsquo;s father
waves incense in front of the cot and brass vessel, and hands over the
gindi, and other articles, to the bridegroom&rsquo;s sister, to be
taken to the bride. Lights and &#257;rathi water are waved before the
bridegroom, and, while the bride&rsquo;s father holds his hands, her
brother washes his feet. He then goes seven times round the cot, after
he has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>worshipped it, and broken cocoanuts, varying in
number according to the nagara to which he belongs&mdash;seven if he is
a member of the seven hundred nagara, and so on. He next takes his seat
on the cot, and is joined by the bride, who has had the b&#257;shingam
put on her forehead, and the t&#257;li tied on her neck, by the
bridegroom&rsquo;s sister. Those assembled then call the maternal
uncles of the bridal couple, and they approach the cot. The
bridegroom&rsquo;s uncle gives the red cloth already referred to to the
uncle of the bride. The bride retires within the house, followed by her
maternal uncle, and sits cross-legged, holding her big toes with her
hands. Her uncle throws the red cloth over her head, and she covers her
face with it. This is called d&#275;vagiri udugar&#275;. The uncle then
carries her to the pandal, and she sits on the left of the bridegroom.
The Gurik&#257;ra asks the maternal uncle of the bridegroom to hand
over the bride&rsquo;s money, amounting to twelve rupees or more. He
then requests permission of the three nagara people, seven g&#333;tra
people, and the relatives of the bride and bridegroom to proceed with
the dh&#257;re ceremony. This being accorded, the maternal uncles unite
the hands of the pair, and, after the cloth has been removed from the
bride&rsquo;s face, the dh&#257;re water is poured over their hands,
first by the bride&rsquo;s father, and then by the Gurik&#257;ra, who,
while doing so, declares the union of the couple according to the
observances of the three nagaras. Those assembled throw rice on, and
give presents to the bride and bridegroom. The presents are called moi,
and the act of giving them moi baikradhu (Tamil). Some women wave
&#257;rathi, and the pair go inside the house, and sit on a mat. Some
milk is given to the bridegroom by the bride&rsquo;s sister, and, after
sipping a little of it, he gives it to the bride. They then return to
the pandal, and sit on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href=
"#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>the cot. Rice is thrown over their
heads, and &#257;rathi waved in front of them. The bridegroom drops a
ring into a tray, and turmeric-water is poured over it. The couple
search for the ring. The wedding ceremonies are brought to a close by
bathing in turmeric-water (vokli bath), after which the couple sit on
the cot, and those assembled permit the handing over of the bride to
the bridegroom&rsquo;s family (pennu oppuchchu kodukradhu).</p>
<p>Any number of marriages, except three or seven, may be carried on
simultaneously beneath a single pandal. If there are more than a single
bridal couple, the b&#257;shingam is worn only by the pair who are the
elder, or held in most respect. Sometimes, one couple is allowed to
wear the b&#257;shingam, and another to have the dh&#257;re water first
poured over them.</p>
<p>The dead are cremated. The corpse is carried to the burning-ground
on a bier, with a tender plantain leaf placed beneath it. Fire is
carried not by the son, but by some other near relative. The ashes are
collected on the third day, and a mound (dh&#363;pe) is made therewith.
Daily until the final death ceremony, a tender cocoanut, and water in a
vessel, are placed near it. In the final death ceremony (bojja), the
Bilimaggas closely follow the Bants, except as regards the funeral car.
To get rid of death pollution, a Tulu Madiv&#257;li (washerman caste)
gives cloths to, and sprinkles water over those under pollution.</p>
<p>The caste title is Setti or Chetti.</p>
<p><b>Billai-kavu</b> (cat-eaters).&mdash;Said to be M&#257;la Paidis,
who eat cats.</p>
<p><b>Billava.&mdash;</b>The Billavas are the Tulu-speaking
toddy-drawers of the South Canara district. It is noted, in the Manual,
that they are &ldquo;the numerically largest caste in the district, and
form close upon one-fifth of the total <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>population. The
derivation of the word Billava, as commonly accepted in the district,
is that it is a contraction of Billinavaru, bowmen, and that the name
was given as the men of that caste were formerly largely employed as
bowmen by the ancient native rulers of the district. There is, however,
no evidence whatever, direct or indirect, to show that the men of the
toddy-drawing caste were in fact so employed. It is well known that,
both before and after the Christian era, there were invasions and
occupations of the northern part of Ceylon by the races then inhabiting
Southern India, and Malabar tradition tells that some of these
Dravidians migrated from &#298;ram or Ceylon northwards to Travancore
and other parts of the West Coast of India, bringing with them the
cocoanut or southern tree (<i lang="la-x-bio">tenginamara</i>), and
being known as T&#299;vars (islanders) or &#298;ravars, which names
have since been altered to T&#299;yars and Ilavars. This derivation
would also explain the name D&#299;varu or Halepaik D&#299;varu borne
by the same class of people in the northern part of the district, and
in North Canara. In Manjarabad above the ghauts, which, with Tuluva,
was in olden days under the rule of the Humcha family, known later as
the Bairasu Wodears of K&#257;rakal, they are called D&#275;varu
Makkalu, literally God&rsquo;s children, but more likely a corruption
of T&#299;varu Makkalu, children of the islanders. In support of this
tradition, Mr. Logan has pointed out<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11712src" href="#xd21e11712" name="xd21e11712src">76</a> that, in
the list of exports from Malabar given in the Periplus, in the first
century A.D., no mention is made of the cocoanut. It was, however,
mentioned by Cosmos Indico Pleustes (522 to 547 A.D.), and from the
Syrian Christians&rsquo; copper-plate grants, early in the ninth
century, it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>appears that the Tiyans were at that time an
organised guild of professional planters. Although the cocoanut tree
may have been introduced by descendants of immigrants from Ceylon
moving up the coast, the practice of planting and drawing toddy was no
doubt taken up by the ordinary Tulu cultivators, and, whatever the
origin of the name Billava may be, they are an essentially Tulu class
of people, following the prevailing rule that property vests in
females, and devolves in the female line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that the Billavas differ from the T&#299;yans
in one very important physical character&mdash;the cranial type. For,
as shown by the following table, whereas the T&#299;yans are
dolichocephalic the Billavas are, like other Tulu classes,
sub-brachycephalic:&mdash;</p>

<p>Some Billavas about Udipi call themselves either Billavaru or
Hal&#275;paikaru. But the Hal&#275;paiks proper are toddy-drawers, who
are found in the Kundap&#363;r t&#257;luk, and speak Kanarese. There
are said to be certain differences between the two classes in the
method of carrying out the process of drawing toddy. For example, the
Hal&#275;paiks generally grasp the knife with the fingers directed
upwards and the thumb to the right, while the Billavas hold the knife
with the fingers directed downwards and the thumb to the left. A
Billava at Udipi had a broad iron knife with a round hole at the base,
by which it was attached to an iron hook fixed on to a rope worn round
the loins. For crushing the flower-buds <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>within the spathe of
the palm, Billavas generally use a stone, and the Hal&#275;paiks a
bone. There is a belief that, if the spathe is beaten with the bone of
a buffalo which has been killed by a tiger, the yield of toddy will, if
the bone has not touched the ground, be greater than if an ordinary
bone is used. The Billavas generally carry a long gourd, and the
Hal&#275;paiks a pot, for collecting the toddy in.</p>
<p>Baidya and P&#363;j&#257;ri occur as caste names of the Billavas,
and also as a suffix to the name, <i>e.g.</i>, Saiyina Baidya, Bomma
P&#363;j&#257;ri. Baidya is said to be a form of Vaidya, meaning a
physician. Some Billavas officiate as priests (p&#363;j&#257;ris) at
bh&#363;tasth&#257;nas (devil shrines) and garidis. Many of these
p&#363;j&#257;ris are credited with the power of invoking the aid of
bh&#363;tas, and curing disease. The following legend is narrated, to
account for the use of the name Baidya. A poor woman once lived at
Ullal with two sons. A Sany&#257;si (religious ascetic), pitying their
condition, took the sons as his sishyas, with a view to training them
as magicians and doctors. After some time, the Sany&#257;si went away
from Ullal for a short time, leaving the lads there with instructions
that they should not be married until his return. In spite of his
instructions, however, they married, and, on his return, he was very
angry, and went away again, followed by his two disciples. On his
journey, the Sany&#257;si crossed the ferry near Ullal on foot. This
the disciples attempted to do, and were on the point of drowning when
the Sany&#257;si threw three handfuls of books on medicine and magic.
Taking these, the two disciples returned, and became learned in
medicine and magic. They are supposed to be the ancestors of the
Billavas.</p>

<p>The Billavas, like the Bants, have a number of exogamous septs
(balis) running in the female line. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>There is a popular
belief that these are sub-divisions of the twenty balis which ought to
exist according to the Aliya Sant&#257;na system (inheritance in the
female line).</p>
<p>The caste has a headman called Gurik&#257;ra, whose office is
hereditary, and passes to the aliya (sister&rsquo;s son). Affairs which
affect the community as a whole are discussed at a meeting held at the
bh&#363;tasth&#257;na or garidi.</p>
<p>At the betrothal ceremony, the bride-price (<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e11779" title="Source: sirdach-chi">sirdachi</span>), varying from
ten to twenty rupees, is fixed. A few days before the wedding, the
maternal uncle of the bride, or the Gurik&#257;ra, ties a jewel on her
neck, and a pandal (booth) is erected, and decorated by the caste
barber (par&#275;l maddiyali) with cloths of different colours. If the
bridegroom is an adult, the bride has to undergo a purificatory
ceremony a day or two before the marriage (dh&#257;re) day. A few
women, usually near relations of the girl, go to a tank (pond) or well
near a Bh&#363;tasth&#257;na or garidi, and bring water thence in
earthenware pots. The water is poured over the head of the girl, and
she bathes. On the wedding day, the bride and bridegroom are seated on
two planks placed on the dais. The barber arranges the various
articles, such as lights, rice, flowers, betel leaves and areca nuts,
and a vessel filled with water, which are required for the ceremonial.
He joins the hands of the contracting couple, and their parents, or the
headman, place the nose-screw of the bridesmaid on their hands, and
pour the dh&#257;re water over them. This is the binding part of the
ceremony, which is called kai (hand) dh&#257;re. Widow remarriage is
called bidu dh&#257;re, and the pouring of water is omitted. The bride
and bridegroom stand facing each other, and a cloth is stretched
between them. The headman unites their hands beneath the screen.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>If a man has intercourse with a woman, and she becomes pregnant, he
has to marry her according to the bidu dh&#257;re rite. Before the
marriage ceremony is performed, he has to grasp a plantain tree with
his right hand, and the tree is then cut down.</p>
<p>At the first menstrual period, a girl is under pollution for ten or
twelve days. On the first day, she is seated within a square (muggu),
and five or seven cocoanuts are tied together so as to form a seat. A
new earthenware pot is placed at each corner of the square. Four girls
from the Gurik&#257;ra&rsquo;s house sit at the corners close to the
pots. Betel leaves, areca nuts, and turmeric paste are distributed
among the assembled females, and the girls pour water from the pots
over the head of the girl. Again, on the eleventh or the thirteenth
day, the girl sits within the square, and water is poured over her as
before. She then bathes.</p>
<p>The dead are usually cremated, though, in some cases, burial is
resorted to. The corpse is washed and laid on a plantain leaf, and a
new cloth is thrown over it. Some paddy (unhusked rice) is heaped up
near the head and feet, and cocoanut cups containing lighted wicks are
placed thereon. All the relations and friends assembled at the house
dip leafy twigs of the tulsi (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ocimum sanctum</i>) in
water, and allow it to drop into the mouth of the corpse. The body is
carried on a plank to the burning-ground. The collection of wood for
the pyre, or the digging of the grave, is the duty of Holeyas. The wood
of <i lang="la-x-bio">Strychnos Nux-vomica</i> should never be used for
the pyre. This is lighted by placing fire at the two ends thereof. When
the flames meet in the middle, the plantain leaf, paddy, etc., which
have been brought from the house, are thrown into them. On the fifth
day, the ashes are collected, and buried on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>the
spot. If the body has been buried, a straw figure is made, and burnt
over the grave, and the ashes are buried there. A small conical mound,
called dh&#363;pe, is made there, and a tulsi plant stuck in it. By the
side of the plant a tender cocoanut with its eyes opened, tobacco leaf,
betel leaves and areca nuts are placed. On the thirteenth day, the
final death ceremonies, or bojja, are performed. On the evening of the
previous day, four poles, for the construction of the upparige or
gudikattu (car), are planted round the dh&#363;pe. At the house, on or
near the spot where the deceased breathed his last, a small bamboo car,
in three tiers, is constructed, and decorated with coloured cloths.
This car is called N&#299;rneralu. A lamp is suspended from the car,
and a cot placed on the ground beneath it, and the jewels and clothes
of the dead person are laid thereon. On the following morning, the
upparige is constructed, with the assistance of the caste barber. A
small vessel, filled with water, is placed within the N&#299;rneralu.
The sons-in-law of the deceased receive a present of new cloths, and,
after bathing, they approach the N&#299;rneralu. The chief mourner
takes the vessel from within it, and pours the water at the foot of a
cocoanut tree. The chief Gurik&#257;ra pours some water into the empty
vessel, and the chief mourner places it within the N&#299;rneralu. Then
seven women measure out some rice three times, and pour the rice into a
tray held by three women. The rice is taken to a well, and washed, and
then brought back to the car. Jaggery (crude sugar) and cocoanut
scrapings are mixed with the rice, which is placed in a cup by seven
women. The cup is deposited within the car on the cot. The wife or
husband of the deceased throws a small quantity of rice into the cup.
She turns the cup, and a ladle placed by its side, upside <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>down, and covers them with a plantain leaf. The
various articles are collected, and tied up in a bundle, which is
placed in a palanquin, and carried in procession, by two men to the
upparige, which has been constructed over the dh&#363;pe. Nalkes and
Paravas (devil-dancers), dressed up as bh&#363;tas, may follow the
procession. Those present go thrice round the upparige, and the chief
mourner unties the bundle, and place its contents on the car. The near
relations put rice, and sometimes vegetables, pumpkins, and plantains,
on the plantain leaf. All present then leave the spot, and the barber
removes the cloths from the car, and pulls it down. Sometimes, if the
dead person has been an important member of the community, a small car
is constructed, and taken in procession round the upparige. On the
fourteenth day, food is offered to crows, and the death ceremonies are
at an end.</p>
<p>If a death occurs on an inauspicious day, a ceremony called
K&#257;le deppuni (driving away the ghost) is performed. Ashes are
spread on the floor of the house, and the door is closed. After some
time, or on the following day, the roof of the house is sprinkled with
turmeric water, and beaten with twigs of <i lang="la-x-bio">Zizyphus
&OElig;noplia</i>. The door is then opened, and the ashes are examined,
to see if the marks of the cloven feet of the ghost are left thereon.
If the marks are clear, it is a sign that the ghost has departed;
otherwise a magician is called in to drive it out. A correspondent
naively remarks that, when he has examined the marks, they were those
of the family cat.</p>
<p>In some cases, girls who have died unmarried are supposed to haunt
the house, and bring trouble thereto, and they must be propitiated by
marriage. The girl&rsquo;s relations go in search of a dead boy, and
take from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>house where he is a quarter of an anna, which is
tied up between two spoons. The spoons are tied to the roof of the
girl&rsquo;s house. This represents the betrothal ceremony. A day is
fixed for the marriage, and, on the appointed day, two figures,
representing the bride and bridegroom, are drawn on the floor, with the
hands lying one on the other. A quarter-anna, black beads, bangles, and
a nose-screw, are placed on the hands, and water is poured on them.
This is symbolical of the dh&#257;re ceremony, and completes the
marriage.</p>
<p>The p&#363;j&#257;ris of all the bh&#363;thasth&#257;nas and garidis
are Billavas. The bh&#363;tha temples called garidis belong to the
Billavas, and the bh&#363;thas are the Baid&#275;rukulu (Koti and
Chennayya), Brimmeru (or Brahmeru) Gunda, Okka Ball&#257;la, Kujumba
Ganja, and D&#275;vanajiri. The Baid&#275;rkulu are believed to be
fellow castemen of the Billavas, and Koti and Chennayya to be descended
from an excommunicated Br&#257;hman girl and a Billava. The legend of
Koti and Chennayya is recorded at length by Mr. A. C. Burnell in the
Indian Antiquary.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11810src" href=
"#xd21e11810" name="xd21e11810src">77</a> The bh&#363;thas are
represented by idols. Brimmeru is the most important, and the others
are subordinate to him. He is represented by a plate of silver or other
metal, bearing the figure of a human being, which is kept within a
car-like stone structure within the shrine. On its left are two human
figures made of clay or stone, which represent the Baid&#275;rukulu. On
the right are a man on horseback, and another figure, representing Okka
Ballala and Kujumba Ganja. Other idols are also set up at the garidi,

and represent bh&#363;thas such as Jumadi, Pancha Jumadi,
Hosabh&#363;tha, Kallurti, etc. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252"

transformed, by Br&#257;hman ingenuity, into Brahma, and all the
bh&#363;thas are converted into G&#333;nas, or attendants on Siva. In
the pardhanas (devil songs) Brimmeru is represented as the principal
bh&#363;tha, and the other bh&#363;thas are supposed to visit his
sth&#257;na. A bh&#363;thasth&#257;na never contains idols, but cots
are usually found therein. A sth&#257;na may be dedicated to a single
bh&#363;tha, or to several bh&#363;thas, and the number may be
ascertained by counting the number of cots, of which each is set apart
for a single bh&#363;tha. If the sth&#257;na is dedicated to more than
one bh&#363;tha, the bh&#363;thas are generally Kodamanith&#257;ya,
Kukkinath&#257;ya, and Daiva. All the arrangements for the periodical
k&#333;la, or festival of the bh&#363;thasth&#257;na, are made by the
p&#363;j&#257;ri. During the festival, he frequently becomes possessed.
Only such Billavas as are liable to be possessed are recognised as
p&#363;j&#257;ris. As a sign of their office, they wear a gold bangle
on the right wrist. Further details in connection with bh&#363;tha
worship will be found in the articles on Bants, Nalkes, and
Paravas.</p>

<p><b>Bissoyi.&mdash;</b>The Parlakimedi M&#257;liahs are, I am
informed, divided up into muttahs, and each muttah contains many
villages, all ruled over by a Bissoyi, a sort of feudal chief, who is
responsible for keeping them in order. Concerning the Bissoyis, Mr. S.
P. Rice writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11832src" href="#xd21e11832"
name="xd21e11832src">78</a> that in the M&#257;liahs &ldquo;are a
number of forts, in which the Bissoyis, or hill chieftains, reside.
Each of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>them holds a small court of his own; each has
his armed retainers, and his executive staff. They were set to rule
over the hill tracts, to curb the lawlessness of the aboriginal tribes
of the mountains, the Khonds and the Savaras. They were, in fact, lords
of the marches, and were in a measure independent, but they appear to
have been under the suzerainty of the R&#257;ja of Kimedi, and they
were also generally responsible to Government. Such men were valuable
friends and dangerous enemies. Their influence among their own men was
complete; their knowledge of their own country was perfect. It was
they, and they only, who could thread their way through the tangled and
well-nigh impenetrable jungle by foot-paths known only to themselves.
Hence, when they became enemies, they could entrench themselves in
positions which were almost impenetrable. Now a road leads to every
fort; the jungles have disappeared; the Bissoyis still have armed
retainers, and still keep a measure of respect; but their sting is
gone, and the officer of Government goes round every year on the
peaceful, if prosaic occupation of examining schools and inspecting
vaccination.&rdquo; The story of the Parlakimedi rebellion, &ldquo;a
forgotten rebellion&rdquo; as he calls it, in the last century, and the
share which the Bissoyis took in it, is graphically told by Mr.
Rice.</p>

wares. The B&#333;g&#257;ras practice the Jaina religion, have the same
g&#333;tras, freely worship in Jain temples, and are accepted into
Jaina society. Evidently they are a sub-division of the Jains, though
now excluded from inter-marriage.&rdquo; It is said that
&ldquo;arrangements are now being made (through the Jaina

converts from the Bombay side. They are traders. In Madras they have
their own high priest and their own mosque (in Georgetown). It is said
that, when one of them dies, the high priest writes a note to the

in Paradise, and that the note is placed in the coffin.&rdquo;<a class=

spot occupied by him during his prayers. They take part in certain
Hindu festivals, <i>e.g.</i>, D&#299;p&#257;vali, or feast of lights,
at which crackers are let off.</p>
<p><b>Boidyo.&mdash;</b>Recorded under the name Boyidyo, in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;literally a physician: a sub-caste of

<p><b>Boishnobo.&mdash;</b>The Boishnobos have been defined as a class
of Oriya religious mendicants and priests to S&#363;dras. The name
means worshippers of Bishnu or Vishnu. Most of them are followers of
Chaitanya, the great Beng&#257;li reformer.</p>
<p><b>Boksha.&mdash;</b>Boksha or Boksham (treasury) is the name of a
sub-division of Gollas, indicating their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

treasury servants in guarding and carrying treasure. In some places,
those who are employed in packing and lifting bags of money in district
treasuries are still called Gollas, though they may belong to some
other caste. In the Census Report, 1901, Bokkisha Vadugar (treasury
northerner) was returned as a Tamil synonym for Golla.</p>
<p><b>Bol&#257;si.&mdash;</b>The Bol&#257;sis are a caste of Oriya
cultivators, who are largely found in the Gums&#363;r t&#257;luk of
Ganjam. Many of them serve as paiks or peons. The original name of the
caste is said to have been Thadia, which has been changed in favour of
Bol&#257;si (Bayalisi, forty-two) in reference to the caste being one
of the recognized forty-two Oriya S&#363;dra castes. It is also
suggested that the name is derived from bola (anklets), as the women
wear heavy brass anklets.</p>
<p>Their ceremonial rites connected with marriage, death, etc., are
similar to those of the Doluvas, Gaudos, Badh&#333;yis, and other
castes. Marriage is infant, and, if a girl does not secure a husband
before she reaches maturity, she goes through a form of marriage with
an arrow or a grinding stone. The Bol&#257;sis are Vaishnavites, and
observe the Paramartho or Chaitanya form thereof. The caste titles are
Podh&#257;no, N&#257;yako, Daso, Mahanti, P&#257;tro, S&#257;hu, Jenna,
and Konhoro.</p>
<p>Gudiyas who are engaged in agriculture are sometimes known as
Bol&#257;si Gudiyas.</p>
<p><b>Bolodia.&mdash;</b>The name of a section of Tellis, who use
pack-bullocks (bolodo, an ox) for carrying grain about the country.
Some Gaudos, at times of census, have also returned Bolodia as their
sub-division.</p>
<p><b>Bombadai</b> (a fish).&mdash;A g&#333;tra of M&#275;dara. The
equivalent Bomidi occurs as an exogamous sept of M&#257;la. Members of
the Vamma g&#333;tra of the Janappans abstain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>from
eating this fish, because, when some of their ancestors went to fetch
water in a marriage pot, they found a number of this fish in the water
collected in the pot.</p>
<p><b>Bomma</b> (a doll).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Padma
S&#257;l&#275;. The equivalent Bommala occurs as an exogamous sept of
M&#257;la. The Bommal&#257;tav&#257;llu are said<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e11947src" href="#xd21e11947" name="xd21e11947src">81</a> to
exhibit shows in the Vizagapatam district.</p>
<p><b>Bommali.&mdash;</b>A sub-division of the Koronos of Ganjam.</p>
<p><b>Bonda.&mdash;</b>A sub-division of Poroja.</p>
<p><b>Bondia.&mdash;</b>A small class, inhabiting Ganjam. The name is
said to be derived from bondono, meaning praise, as the Bondias are
those who praise and flatter R&#257;jas.</p>
<p><b>Bondili.&mdash;</b>In the Madras Census Report, 1891, the
Bondilis are &ldquo;said to derive their name from Bundelkund. They
claim to be R&#257;jputs, but appear to have degenerated. The Sivaites
of this sect are said to bury their dead, while the Vishnavaites burn.
In the Kadri t&#257;luk of Cuddapah all are said to bury. The custom in
this respect appears to differ in different localities. Besides Siva
and Vishnu worship, three of the eight authorities who give particulars
of this section agree that they worship village deities as well. All
state that remarriage of widows is not permitted. They are generally
cultivators, peons, or the body-guards of Zemindars.&rdquo; The
Bondilis of the North Arcot district are described by Mr. H. A.
Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11966src" href="#xd21e11966" name=
"xd21e11966src">82</a> as being &ldquo;foreigners from Bundelkund, from
which fact their name originates, and of various Vaisya and S&#363;dra
castes; the former having the termination L&#257;la to their names, and
the latter that of R&#257;m. Many of the S&#363;dra Bondilis,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>however, improperly take the title Singh, and
say they are Kshatriyas, that is, R&#257;jputs. The Vaisya Bondilis are
few in number, and only found in Vellore, Chittoor and Arni, where they
are usually money-lenders. The S&#363;dras are mostly sepoys,
constables, or revenue peons. Some say that they are not even
S&#363;dras, but the descendants of R&#257;jputs by women of the
country, and probably many of them are such. All are very particular
with respect to eating with an other professed Bondili, and refuse to
do so unless they are quite certain that he is of their class. In their
marriage customs they resemble the R&#257;jputs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am informed that one section of the Bondilis is named T&#333;li,
in reference to their being workers in leather. There is, at
Venkatagiri, a street called T&#333;li mitta, or T&#333;li quarters,
and, in former days, the inhabitants thereof were not allowed to enter
the temples.</p>
<p>In the Census Report, 1901, Guv&#257;lo, or traders from
Sambalp&#363;r, is returned as a sub-caste of Bondili.</p>
<p><b>Boniya.&mdash;</b>The Oriya name for Baniya (trader). Boniya
Korono appears<a class="noteref" id="xd21e11979src" href="#xd21e11979"
name="xd21e11979src">83</a> as the name for traders and shopkeepers in
Ganjam.</p>
<p><b>Bonka.&mdash;</b>Recorded, in the Vizagapatam Manual, as
cultivators in the Jeypore hills, and, in the Madras Census Report,
1901, as a small Oriya caste of hill cultivators, which has three
sub-divisions, Bonka, Pata Bonka, and Goru Bonka.</p>
<p><b>Bonthuk.&mdash;</b>The Bonthuks or Bonthuk Savaras are scattered
about the Kistna and Gunt&#363;r districts, and lead a nomad life,
carrying their small dwelling-huts with them as they shift from place
to place. They are called Bonthuk Savaras to distinguish them from the
Pothra <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>(stone) Savaras, who dwell further north. By
Telugu people they are called Chenchu or Bontha Chenchu, though they
have no connection with the Chenchus who inhabit the hills in Kurnool,
and other parts of the Telugu country. The Bonthuks, however, like the
Chenchus, claim Ahobila Narasimha as their tribal deity. The Bonthuks
speak the Oriya language, and they have a Mongoloid type of features,
such as are possessed by the Savaras of Ganjam and Vizagapatam. Their
house-names, or intip&#275;ralu, however are Telugu. These constitute
exogamous septs, and seem to be as follows:&mdash;Pasupuretti,
Simh&#257;dri (the god at Simhachalam near Vizagapatam), Kon&#275;ti,
D&#257;sapatri, G&#275;dala (buffaloes), Kudumala (cakes), &#256;kula
(leaves), Sunkara, and T&#333;ta (garden). At marriages, individuals of
the Pasupuretti sept officiate as priests, and members of the
Kon&#275;ti sept as drummers and musicians. Men belonging to the
G&#275;dalu sept are considered as equivalent to shepherds.</p>
<p>The Bonthuks have a very interesting way of naming their children.
If a child is born when an official or person of some distinction
happens to be near their encampment, it is named after him. Thus such
names as Collector, Tahsildar, Kolnol (Colonel), Governor, Innes,
Superintendent, and Acharlu (after one Sukracharlu) are met with.
Sometimes children are named after a town or village, either because
they were born there, or in the performance of a vow to some place of
pilgrimage. In this way, such names as Hyderabad, Channapatam (Madras),
Bandar (Masulipatam), Nellore, and Tirupati arise. A boy was named
Tuyya (parrot), because a parrot was brought into the settlement at the
time of his birth. Another child was called Beni because, at its birth,
a bamboo flute (beni) was played. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260"
href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span></p>
<p>Every settlement is said to have a headman, called Bich&#257;di,
who, in consultation with several elders of the tribe, settles disputes
and various affairs affecting the community. If an individual has been
fined, and does not accept the punishment, he may appeal to another
Bich&#257;di, who may enhance the fine. Sometimes those who do not
agree to abide by the decision of the Bich&#257;di have to undergo a
trial by ordeal, by taking out an areca nut from a pot of boiling
cowdung water. The dimensions of the pot, in height and breadth, should
not exceed the span of the hand, and the height of the cowdung water in
the pot should be that of the middle finger from the base to the tip.
If, in removing the nut from the pot, the hand is injured, the guilt of
the individual is proved. Before the trial by ordeal, a sum of ten
rupees is deposited by both complainant and accused with the
Bich&#257;di, and the person under trial may not live in his
dwelling-hut. He lives in a grove or in the forest, watched by two
members of the Pasupuretti sept.</p>
<p>The Bonthuks are engaged in collecting bamboos, and selling them
after straightening them by heating them in the fire. Before the
bamboos are placed in carts, for conveyance to the settlement, a goat
and fowls are sacrificed to Satyamma, Dodlamma, Muthyalamma, and
Pothur&#257;ju, who are represented by stones.</p>
<p>Girls are married before puberty, and, if a girl happens to be mated
only after she has reached maturity, there is no marriage ceremonial.
The marriage rites last over five days, on the first of which a brass
vessel, with a thread tied round its neck, and containing turmeric
water and the oyila tokka or tonko (bride&rsquo;s money), is carried in
procession to the bride&rsquo;s hut on the head of a married girl
belonging to a sept other than those of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>contracting couple. She has on her head a hood
decorated with little bells, and the vessel is supported on a cloth
pad. When the hut is reached, the bride&rsquo;s money is handed over to
the Bich&#257;di, and the turmeric water is poured on the ground. The
bride&rsquo;s money is divided between her parents and maternal uncle,
the Bich&#257;di, and the caste men. A pig is purchased, and carried by
two men on a pole to the scene of the marriage. The caste people, and
the married girl carrying a brass vessel, go round the animal, to the
accompaniment of music. The girl, as she goes round, pours water from
the vessel on the ground. A thread is tied round the neck of the pig,
which is taken to the bridegroom&rsquo;s hut, and cut up into two
portions, for the parties of the bridegroom and bride, of which the
former is cooked and eaten on the same day. At the homes of the bride
and bridegroom, a pandal (booth) and dais are erected. The materials
for the former are brought by seven women, and for the latter by nine
men. The pandal is usually decorated with mango and <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Eugenia Arnoltiana</i> leaves. After supper, some relations
of the contracting couple go to an open space, where the Bich&#257;di,
who has by him two pots and two bashingams (chaplets) of arka (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Calotropis gigantea</i>) flowers, is seated with a few men.
The fathers of the bride and bridegroom ask the Bich&#257;di to give
them the bashingams, and this he does after receiving an assurance that
the wedding will not be attended by quarrelling. The bride and
bridegroom take their seats on the dais at the home of the latter, and
the officiating priest ties the bashingams on their foreheads. Nine men
and seven women stand near the dais, and a thread is passed round them
seven times. This thread is cut up by the priest, and used for the
kankanams (wrist threads) of the bride and bridegroom. These are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>removed, at the close of the marriage
festivities, on the fifth day.</p>
<p>When a girl attains maturity, she is under pollution for nine days,
at the conclusion of which the Bich&#257;di receives a small present of
money from her parents. Her husband, and his agnates (people of his
sept) also have to observe pollution, and, on the ninth day, the
cooking pots which they have used are thrown away, and they proceed to
the Bich&#257;di, to whom they make a present of money, as they have
probably broken the tribal rule that smoking is forbidden when under
pollution. On the ninth day, the girl and her husband throw water over
each other, and the marriage is consummated.</p>
<p>The dead are usually buried, lying on the left side. On the second
day, food is offered to crows and Br&#257;hmani kites. On the eleventh
day, a mat is spread on the floor of the hut, and covered with a clean
sheet, on which balls of food are placed. The dead person is invoked by
name, as the various people deposit the food offering. The food is
finally put into a winnowing basket, and taken to the bank of a tank
(pond). A small hut is made there, and the food is placed therein on
two leaves, one of which represents the Yama Dutas (servants of the god
of death), the other the deceased.</p>
<p><b>Boori</b> (cake).&mdash;An exogamous sept of M&#257;la.</p>
<p><b>Bosantiya.&mdash;</b>The Bosantiyas are summed up, in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;Oriya cultivators found in the northern
t&#257;luks of Ganjam. They are said by some to have been originally
dyers.&rdquo; I am informed that the caste name has reference to the
fact that the occupation thereof was the collection of the fruits of
<i lang="la-x-bio">Mallotus philippinensis</i>, and trade in the dye
(bosonto gundi) obtained therefrom. The dye, commonly known as
kam&#275;la, or kamala, is the powdery substance obtained <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>as a
glandular pubescence from the exterior of the fruits. The following
note on the dye was published in the Indian Forester, 1892.
&ldquo;Among the many rich natural products of Ganjam, probably the
most esteemed in commerce is the red kam&#275;la dye, the valuable
product of the <i lang="la-x-bio">Mallotus philippinensis</i>. This
tree, with its lovely scarlet berries and vivid emerald green foliage,
is a marked feature of forest scenery in Ganjam. The berries are coated
with a beautiful red powder, which constitutes the dye. This powder is
collected by being brushed off into baskets made for the purpose, but
the method of collection is reckless and wasteful in the extreme, the
trees being often felled in order to reach the berries more easily. The
industry is a monopoly of the Hill Khonds, who, however, turn it to
little advantage. They are ignorant of the great commercial value of
the dye, and part with the powder to the low-country dealers settled
among them for a few measures of rice or a yard or two of cloth. The
industry is capable of great development, and a large fortune awaits
the firm or individual with sufficient enterprise to enter into rivalry
with the low-country native dealers settled among the Khonds, who at
present enjoy a monopoly of the trade. It is notorious that these men
are accumulating vast profits in respect of this dye. The tree is
cultivated largely by the Khonds in their forest villages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bosantiyas seem to have no sub-divisions, but exogamous
g&#333;tras, <i>e.g.</i>, n&#257;gasira (cobra) and kochimo (tortoise)
exist among them. Socially they are on a par with the Bhond&#257;ris,
and above Pachchilia Gaudos and S&#257;mantiyas. They have a headman
called Bissoyi, who is assisted by a Bhollobaya, and they have further
a caste messenger called J&#257;ti Naiko. The caste titles are Bissoyi
and N&#257;hako. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264"
name="pb264">264</a>]</span></p>
<p>Most of the Bosantiyas are Saivites, but a few follow the Paramartho
form of Vaishnavism. They also worship various T&#257;kur&#257;nis
(village deities), such as Kot&#257;ru and Chondi.</p>
<p>In the Vizagapatam Manual (1869), Bosuntea is described as a caste
of Paiks or fighting men in the Vizagapatam district (Jeypore).</p>
<p><b>Bottada.&mdash;</b>The Bottadas are, Mr. H. A. Stuart
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12047src" href="#xd21e12047" name=
"xd21e12047src">84</a> &ldquo;a Class of Uriya cultivators and
labourers, speaking Muria or Lucia, otherwise known as Basturia, a
dialect of Uriya. Mr. Taylor says the caste is the same as Muria, which
is shown separately in the tables, and in Mr. H. G. Turner&rsquo;s
notes in the Census Report of 1871. But, whether identical or distinct,
it seems clear that both are sub-divisions of the great Gond
tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following note, I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao.
There is a current tradition that the caste originally dwelt at
Barthagada, and emigrated to Vizagapatam long ago. It is vaguely
mentioned that Barthagada was situated towards and beyond Bastar, near
which place there are still to be found people of this caste, with whom
those living in the Vizagapatam Agency intermarry. The caste is divided
into three endogamous divisions, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Bodo, or genuine Bottadas;</li>
<li>(2) Madhya, descendants of Bottada men and non-Bottada women;</li>
<li>(3) Sanno, descendants of Madhya men and non-Madhya women. The
Bodos will not interdine with the other two sections, but males of
these will eat with Bodos.</li>

<p>Girls are married either before or after puberty. A man can claim
his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter in marriage. When a marriage is
under contemplation, the prospective bridegroom&rsquo;s parents take
maddho (liquor) and chada (beaten rice) to the girl&rsquo;s house,
where they are accepted or refused, according as her parents agree to,
or disapprove of the match. After a stated period, further presents of
liquor, rice, black gram, dh&#257;l, salt, chillies, and jaggery (crude
sugar) are brought, and betel leaves and areca nuts given in exchange.
Two days later the girl&rsquo;s parents pay a return visit to those of
the young man. After another interval, the marriage takes place. Nine
days before its celebration, paddy (unhusked rice) and Rs. 2 are taken
to the bride&rsquo;s house as jholla tonka, and a feast is held. At the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house, a pandal, made of nine sorghi or s&#257;l
(<i>Shorca robusta</i>) posts, is erected, with a pot of turmeric water
tied to the central post. The bride is conducted thither. At the
marriage rites the D&#275;s&#257;ri officiates. The ends of the cloths
of the contracting couple are tied together, and their little fingers
are linked together, while they go, with pieces of turmeric and rice in
their hands, seven times round the pandal. The sacred fire, or
h&#333;mam, is raised, and into it seven or nine different kinds of
wood, gh&#299; (clarified butter), milk, rice and jaggery are thrown.
Turmeric-rice dots are put on the foreheads of the bride and bridegroom
by the D&#275;s&#257;ri, parents, and relations. They <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>are
anointed with castor-oil, and bathed with the water contained in the
pot tied to the post. New cloths are presented to them, and a caste
feast is held.</p>
<p>Widow remarriage is permitted, and a younger brother often marries
the widow of his elder brother. If, however, she marries any one else,
her new husband has to pay r&#257;nd tonka, consisting of liquor, a
sheep or goat, and rice, as a fine to the caste, or he may compound for
payment of five rupees. Divorce is permitted, and, if a man divorces
his wife, he usually gives her some paddy, a new cloth, and a rupee. If
the woman divorces herself from her husband, and contracts an alliance
with another man, the latter has to pay a fine of twenty rupees to the
first husband, a portion of which is spent on a feast, at which the two
husbands and the woman are present.</p>
<p>The dead are burned, and death pollution is observed for ten days,
during which no agricultural work is done, and no food is cooked in the
bamsa of the deceased, which is fed by some related bamsa. On the day
following cremation, a new pot with water, and some sand are carried to
the spot where the corpse was burnt. A bed of sand is made, in which a
banyan (<i>Ficus bengalensis</i>) or p&#299;pal (<i>Ficus
religiosa</i>) is planted. A hole is made in the pot, and the plant
watered. On the tenth day, on which a bath is taken, some fried rice
and a new pot are carried to the burning-ground, and left there.</p>
<p>The Bottadas have the reputation of being the best cultivators in
the Jeypore Agency, and they take a high position in social rank. Many
of them wear the sacred thread, at the time of marriage and
subsequently, and it is said that the right to wear it was acquired by
purchase from former R&#257;jas of Jeypore.</p>

<p><b>Br&#257;hman.&mdash;</b>The Br&#257;hmans of Southern India are
divided into a number of sections, differing in language, manners and
customs. As regards their origin, the current belief is that they
sprang from the mouth of Brahma. In support thereof, the following
verse from the Purusha S&#363;ktha (hymn of the prim&aelig;val male) of
the Rig V&#275;da is quoted:&mdash;From the face of Praj&#257;pathi
(Viratpurusha) came the Br&#257;hmans; from the arms arose the
Kshatriyas; from the thighs sprang the Vaisyas; and from the feet the
S&#363;dras. Mention of the fourfold division of the Hindu castes is
also made in other V&#275;das, and in Ithih&#257;sas and
Pur&#257;nas.</p>
<p>The Br&#257;hmans fall into three groups, following the three
V&#275;das or S&#257;kas, Rig, Yajus, and Samam. This threefold
division is, however, recognised only for ceremonial purposes. For
marriage and social purposes, the divisions based on language and
locality are practically more operative. In the matter of the more
important religious rites, the Br&#257;hmans of Southern India, as
elsewhere, closely follow their own V&#275;das. Every Br&#257;hman
belongs to one or other of the numerous g&#333;tras <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>mentioned in Pravara and G&#333;tra Kandams. All
the religious rites are performed according to the Grihya S&#363;tras
(ritual books) pertaining to their S&#257;ka or V&#275;da. Of these,
there are eight kinds now in vogue, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>All Br&#257;hmans claim descent from one or more of the following
seven Rishis:&mdash;Atri, Bhrigu, Kutsa, Vashista, Gautama, Kasyapa,
Angiras. According to some, the Rishis are Agasthya, Angiras, Atri,
Bhrigu, Kasyapa, Vashista, and Gautama. Under these Rishis are included
eighteen ganams, and under each ganam there are a number of
g&#333;tras, amounting in all to about 230. Every Br&#257;hman is
expected to salute his superiors by repeating the Abhiv&#257;dhanam
(salutation) which contains his lineage. As an example, the following
may be given:&mdash;&ldquo;I, Krishna by name, of Srivathsa g&#333;tra,
with the pravara (lineage) of the five Rishis, Bhargava, Chy&#257;vana,
&#256;pnuvana, Aruva, and Jamadagni, following the &#256;pasthamba
s&#363;tra of the Yajus S&#257;ka, am now saluting you.&rdquo; Daily,
at the close of the Sandhya prayers, this Abhiv&#257;dhanam formula
should be repeated by every Br&#257;hman.</p>
<p>Taking the Br&#257;hmans as a whole, it is customary to group them
in two main divisions, the Pancha Dr&#257;vidas and Pancha Gaudas. The
Pancha Dr&#257;vidas are pure vegetarians, whereas the Pancha Gaudas
need not abstain from meat and fish, though some, who live amidst the
Pancha Dr&#257;vidas, do so. Other differences will be noted in
connection with Oriya Br&#257;hmans, who belong to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>Pancha Gauda section. In South India, all
Br&#257;hmans, except those who speak the Oriya and Konkani languages,
are Pancha Dr&#257;vidas, who are divided into five sections,
viz.:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> Tamil, or Dr&#257;vida proper.</li>
<li><span>2.</span> Telugu or &#256;ndhra.</li>
<li><span>3.</span> Canarese, or Carn&#257;taka.</li>
<li><span>4.</span> Marathi or D&#275;sastha.</li>
<li><span>5.</span> Guzar&#257;ti.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Tulu-speaking Shivalli Br&#257;hmans are included among the
Carn&#257;takas; the Pattar and Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hmans
(<i>see</i> Namb&#363;tiri) among the Dr&#257;vidas proper.</p>
<p>From a religious point of view, the Br&#257;hmans are either
Saivites or Vaishnavites. The Saivites are either Saivites proper, or
Smarthas. The Smarthas believe that the soul of man is only a portion
of the infinite spirit (&#257;tman), and that it is capable of becoming
absorbed into the &#257;tman. They recognise the Trimurtis, Brahma,
Vishnu, and Siva as separate gods, but only as equal manifestations of
the supreme spirit, and that, in the end, these are to be absorbed into
the infinite spirit, and so disappear. Saivas, on the other hand, do
not recognise the Trimurtis, and believe only in one god, Siva, who is
self-existent, and not liable to lose his personality. Of Vaishnavites
there are three kinds, viz., those who are the followers of Chaitanya,
R&#257;m&#257;nuja, and M&#257;dhv&#257;ch&#257;rya. Like the Smarthas,
the Vaishnavites recognise Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, but Vishnu is
supposed to be the chief god, to whom the others are subordinate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vaishnavas,&rdquo; Monier Williams writes,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e12207src" href="#xd21e12207" name="xd21e12207src">86</a>
&ldquo;are believers in the one personal god Vishnu, not only as the
preserver, but as above every other god, including Siva. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>It
should be noted, too, that both Saivites and Vaishnavas agree in
attributing an essential form of qualities to the Supreme Being. Their
one god, in fact, exists in an eternal body, which is antecedent to his
earthly incarnations, and survives all such incarnations.&rdquo; He
adds that &ldquo;it cannot be doubted that one great conservative
element of Hinduism is the many sidedness of Vaishnavism. For
Vaishnavism is, like Buddhism, the most tolerant of systems. It is
always ready to accommodate itself to other creeds, and delights in
appropriating to itself the religious idea of all the nations of the
world. It admits of every form of internal development. It has no
organised hierarchy under one supreme head, but it may have any number
of separate associations under separate leaders, who are ever banding
themselves together for the extension of spiritual supremacy over ever
increasing masses of population.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Oriya Br&#257;hmans, who follow the creed of Chaitanya, are
called Paramarthos, and are confined to the Ganjam district. There is
no objection to intermarriage between Smartha and Paramartho Oriya
Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p>Sri Vaishnavas (who put on the n&#257;mam as a sectarian mark) and
M&#257;dhvas are exclusive as regards intermarriage, but the
M&#257;dhvas have no objection to taking meals with, and at the houses
of Smarthas, whereas Sri Vaishnavas object to doing so.</p>
<p>According to the S&#363;tras, a Br&#257;hman has to go through the
following samsk&#257;ras (rites):&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> Garbh&#257;d&#257;na.</li>
<li><span>2.</span> Pumsavanam.</li>
<li><span>3.</span> S&#299;mantam.</li>
<li><span>4.</span> J&#257;takarmam.</li>
<li><span>5.</span> N&#257;makaranam.</li>
<li><span>6.</span> Annapr&#257;sanam</li>
<li><span>7.</span> Chaulam.</li>
<li><span>8.</span> Upanayanam</li>
<li><span>9.</span> Viv&#257;ham.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>These rites are supposed to purify the body and spirit from the
taint transmitted through the womb of the mother, but all of them are
not at the present day performed at the proper time, and in regular
order.</p>
<p>The Garbh&#257;dh&#257;na, or impregnation ceremony, should,
according to the Grihya S&#363;tras, be performed on the fourth day of
the marriage ceremonies. But, as the bride is a young girl, it is
omitted, or V&#275;dic texts are repeated. The Garbh&#257;dh&#257;na
ceremony is performed, after the girl has attained puberty. At the time
of consummation or Ritu S&#257;nthi, the following verse is
repeated:&mdash;&ldquo;Let all pervading Vishnu prepare her womb; let
the Creator shape its forms; let Praj&#257;pathi be the impregnator;
let the Creator give the embryo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pumsavanam and S&#299;mantam are two ceremonies, which are performed
together during the seventh or ninth month of the first pregnancy,
though, according to the Grihya S&#363;tras, the former should be
performed in the third month. At the Pumsavanam, or male producing
ceremony, the pregnant woman fasts, and her husband squeezes into her
right nostril a little juice from the fruit and twig of the &#257;lam
tree (<i>Ficus bengalensis</i>), saying &ldquo;Thou art a male
child.&rdquo; The twig selected should be one pointing, east or north;
with two fruits looking like testicles. The twig is placed on a
grinding-stone, and a girl, who has not attained puberty, is asked to
pound it. The pulp is wrapped in a new silk cloth, and squeezed to
express the juice. On the conclusion of the Pumsavanam, the
S&#299;mantam, or parting the pregnant woman&rsquo;s hair, is gone
through. After oblations in the sacred fire (h&#333;mam), the
woman&rsquo;s husband takes a porcupine quill, to which three blades of
dharbha grass, and a twig with fruits of the aththi tree (<i>Ficus
glomerata</i>) are attached, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href=
"#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>and passes it over the
woman&rsquo;s head from before backwards, parting the hair.</p>
<p>The J&#257;takarmam, N&#257;makaranam, Annapr&#257;sanam, and
Chaulam rites are ordinarily celebrated, one after the other, on the
Upanayanam day. J&#257;takarmam consists in smearing some gh&#299;
(clarified butter) and honey on the tongue of the baby, and repeating
the following verses from the Rig V&#275;da:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! long
lived one, mayst thou live a hundred years in this world, protected by
the gods. Become firm as a rock, firm as an axe, pure as gold. Thou art
the V&#275;da called a son; live thou a hundred years. May Indra bestow
on thee his best treasures. May S&#257;vitri, may Sarasvati, may the
Asvins grant thee wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the N&#257;makaranam, or naming ceremony, the parents of the
child pronounce its name close to its ear, and repeat the V&#275;dic
prayer to Indra and Agni &ldquo;May Indra give you lustre, and Indra
semen, wisdom, and children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Annapr&#257;sanam, or food-giving ceremony, should be performed
during the sixth month after birth. A little solid food is put into the
child&rsquo;s mouth, and the following V&#275;dic verses are
repeated:&mdash;&ldquo;Agni who lives on plants, S&#333;ma who lives on
s&#333;ma juice, Br&#257;hmans who live on the V&#275;das, and
D&#275;vatas who live on amartam (ambrosia), may they bless you. As the
earth gives food to plants and water, so I give you this food. May
these waters and plants give you prosperity and health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Chaulam, or tonsure ceremony, the child is seated in his
mother&rsquo;s lap. The father, taking a few blades of dharbha grass in
his hand, sprinkles water over the child&rsquo;s head. Seven times he
inserts blades of dharbha in the hair of the head (three blades each
time), saying &ldquo;Oh! divine grass, protect him.&rdquo; He
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>then cuts off the tips of the blades, and throws
them away. The father is expected, according to the Grihya S&#363;tras,
to shave or cut the child&rsquo;s hair. At the present day, however,
the barber is called in, and shaves the head, leaving one lock or more
according to local custom.</p>
<p>The Upanayana, or leading a boy to his guru or spiritual teacher, is
essentially a ceremony of initiation. From an orthodox point of view,
this ceremony should be performed before the age of eight years, but in
practice it is deferred even up to the age of seventeen. It usually
commences with the arrangement of seed-pans containing nine kinds of
grain, and tying a thread or pratisaram on the boy&rsquo;s wrist. After
this, the Abyudayam, or invocation of ancestors, is gone through. The
boy sits in front of the sacred fire, and his father, or some other
person, sits by his side, to help him in the ceremonial and act the
part of guru. He places over the boy&rsquo;s head blades of dharbha
grass so that the tips are towards the east, south, west, and north.
The tips are cut off, and the following V&#275;dic verses are
repeated:&mdash;&ldquo;Please permit me to shave the head of this boy
with the knife used by the sun for shaving S&#333;ma. He is to be
shaved, because it will bring him long life and old age. May the boy
become great, and not die a premature death. May he outshine all in
glory.&rdquo; The boy is then shaved by a barber, and more V&#275;dic
verses are repeated, which run as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;You are shaving
with a sharp razor, so that this shaving may enable him to live long.
Brihaspathi, S&#363;rya, and Agni shaved the hair of the head of
Varuna, and placed the hairs in the middle regions of the sky, earth,
and in swarga. I shall place the hairs removed by me at the foot of the
audambara tree (<i>Ficus glomerata</i>), or in the clumps of dharbha
grass.&rdquo; The boy then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>bathes, and comes near the sacred
fire. After gh&#299; has been poured thereon, a bundle of pal&#257;sa
(<i>Butea frondosa</i>) sticks is given to him, and he puts it on the
fire after repeating certain V&#275;dic riks. A grinding-stone is
placed on one side of the fire, and the boy treads on it, while the
following verse is repeated:&mdash;&ldquo;Tread on this stone, and may
you be as firm as it is. May you subdue thy enemies.&rdquo; A new cloth
is given to him, which he puts on. The following verses are then
repeated:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! cloth, Revathi and others have spun, woven,
spread out, and put skirts on both sides of you. May these goddesses
clothe the boy with long life. Blessed with life, put on this cloth.
Dress the boy with this cloth. By wearing it, let him attain a hundred
years of age. May his life be extended. Such a garment as this was
given to S&#333;ma by Brihaspathi to wear. Mayst thou reach old age.
Put on this cloth. Be a protector to all people. May you live a hundred
years with full vigour. May you have plenty of wealth.&rdquo; After the
boy has put on the cloth, the following is repeated:&mdash;&ldquo;You
have put on this cloth for the sake of blessing. You have become the
protector of your friends. Live a hundred years. A noble man, blessed
with life, mayst thou obtain wealth.&rdquo; A girdle (minji) spun from
grass is wound thrice round the boy&rsquo;s body, and tied with a knot
opposite the navel, or to the left of it. The following verses are
repeated:&mdash;&ldquo;This blessed girdle, the friend of the gods, has
come to us to remove our sins, to purify and protect us, bring strength
to us by the power of exhalation and inhalation. Protect, Oh! girdle,
our wealth and meditation. Destroy our enemies, and guard us on all the
four sides.&rdquo; A small piece of deer-skin is next tied on to the
sacred thread, which has been put on the boy soon after the shaving
rite. The following verses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href=
"#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>are repeated:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh!
skin which is full of lustre because Mitra sees you, full of glory and
one that is not fit for wicked people, I am now putting you on. May
Aditi tuck up thy garment. Thou mayst read V&#275;das, and grow wise.
Thou mayst not forget what you have read. Mayst thou become holy and
glorious.&rdquo; The boy seats himself next to the guru, and close to
the sacred fire, and repeats the following:&mdash;&ldquo;I have come
near the spiritual teacher, my &#256;ch&#257;rya. May the teacher and
myself become prosperous. May I also complete my V&#275;dic studies
properly, and let me be blessed with a married life after the
study.&rdquo; The guru sprinkles water over the boy three times, and,
taking hold of his hand, says:&mdash;&ldquo;Agni, S&#333;man, Savitha,
Sarasvati, P&#363;sha, Aryaman, Amsuhu, Bagad&#275;vata, and Mitra have
seized thy hand. They have taken you over to them, and you have become
friends.&rdquo; Then he hands over the boy to the gods by
repeating:&mdash;&ldquo;We give you to Agni, S&#333;man, Savitha,
Sarasvati, Mrityu, Yaman, Gadhan, Andhakan, Abhaya, &#332;shadhi,
Prithvi, and Vaisv&#257;nara. With the permission of S&#363;rya, I am
allowing you to approach me. Oh! boy, may you have children full of
lustre, and capable of becoming heroes.&rdquo; The boy then repeats the
following:&mdash;&ldquo;I am come to be a student. You that have
obtained permission from the S&#363;rya, please take me.&rdquo; The
teacher asks, &ldquo;Who are you? What is your name?<span class="corr"
id="xd21e12294" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> The boy gives out
his name, and the teacher enquires of him what kind of Brahmachari he
is. The boy replies that he is a Brahmachari for &#256;tman, and
repeats the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! sun, the lord of all ways,
through your grace I am about to begin my studies, which will do good
to me.&rdquo; The teacher and the boy take their seats on dharbha
grass, and say:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! dharbha, a giver of royal power, a
teacher&rsquo;s seat, may I not withdraw <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>from thee.&rdquo; The
boy then pours some gh&#299; on to the sacred fire. A cloth is thrown
over both the teacher and the boy, and the latter asks the former to
recite the S&#257;vitri. The following G&#257;yatri is repeated into
his ear:&mdash;&ldquo;Let us meditate on that excellent glory of the
divine vivifier. May he illumine our understandings.&rdquo; The boy
touches his own upper lip with his right hand, and
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! Pr&#257;na, I have become illumined, having
heard the S&#257;vitri. Protect and guard this wealth that has entered
me, the G&#257;yatri or S&#257;vitri.&rdquo; He then takes the
pal&#257;sa staff, and the teacher says:&mdash;&ldquo;Up with life. Oh!
sun, this is thy son. I give him in charge to thee.&rdquo; The boy then
worships the sun thus:&mdash;&ldquo;That bright eye created by the
gods, which rises in the east, may we see it a hundred autumns; may we
live a hundred autumns; may we rejoice a hundred autumns; may we live a
hundred autumns; may we rejoice a hundred autumns; may we be glad a
hundred autumns; may we prosper a hundred autumns; may we speak a
hundred autumns; may we live undecaying a hundred autumns; and may we
long see the sun.&rdquo; The ceremonial is brought to a close on the
first day by the boy begging rice from his mother and other female
relations. A basket, filled with rice, is placed in a pandal (booth),
and the boy stands near it, repeating &ldquo;Please give me
alms.&rdquo; Each woman pours some rice into a tray which he carries,
and presents him with some money and betel leaves. The rice is placed
in the basket. On the second and third days, the boy puts pal&#257;sa
sticks into the sacred fire, and pours gh&#299; thereon. On the fourth
day, the new cloth is given to the teacher.</p>
<p>The wearing of the sacred thread is a sign that the boy has gone
through the upanayanam ceremony. It is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

son of Br&#257;hman parents is not reckoned to be a Br&#257;hman
<i>(i.e.</i>, he may not take part in religious ceremonies) until he
has gone through the ceremony of assuming the sacred thread; and I have
heard Br&#257;hman boys wearing the thread taunting a boy of
Br&#257;hman birth, and calling him a S&#363;dra, because he had not
yet assumed the holy thread.&rdquo; The thread is composed of three
threads of cotton secured together in one spot by a sacred knot of
peculiar construction, called Brahma Grandhi. The knot in the sacred
thread worn by Vaishnava Br&#257;hmans is called Vishnu Grandhi, and
that in the thread of Smarthas R&#363;dra Grandhi. In the preparation
of the thread, cotton sold in the bazaar may not be used; the bolls
ought to be secured direct from the plant. Here and there Br&#257;hmans
may be seen in villages, removing the cotton from the bolls, and
preparing it into pads for spinning into thread. Those who teach
students the V&#275;das may be seen spinning the thread from these
pads. The spinning rod is a thin piece of bamboo stick weighted with a
lead or soapstone disc about half an inch in diameter. The thin thread
is kept in stock, and twisted into the sacred thread whenever it is
required. Three or more people usually take part in the twisting
process, during which they chant V&#275;dic verses. In the Srutis and
S&#363;tras, it is enjoined that the Yagnopavita (sacred thread) is to
be put on only on occasions of sacrifice. It ought really to be a
vestment, and is a symbolical representation thereof. Ordinarily the
thread is worn over the left shoulder in the position called
Upav&#299;tham. In ceremonies connected with the dead, however, it is
worn over the right shoulder in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb278" href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>position called
pr&#257;chinav&#299;thi. At the time of worshipping Rishis and Ganas,
the thread should be over both shoulders and round the neck in the
position called niv&#299;thi.</p>
<p>The grass girdle and deer-skin worn by a youth at the Upanayanam
ceremony are removed on the fifth day, or, among the orthodox, kept on
until the first Up&#257;karmam day. They, and the pal&#257;sa stick,
should be retained by the Brahmach&#257;ri till the close of his
studentship. Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hman lads of eight or nine years
old, who have gone through the Upanayanam ceremony, always carry with
them the pal&#257;sa stick, and wear the grass girdle, and, in addition
to the sacred thread, a thin strip of deer-skin in length equal to the
thread. Round the waist he wears a narrow strip of cloth
(kaup&#299;nam) passed between the legs. He may cover his breast and
abdomen with a cloth thrown over his body. He is thus clad until his
marriage, or at least until he has concluded the study of the
V&#275;das.</p>
<p>The marriage rites in vogue at the present day resemble those of
V&#275;dic times in all essential particulars. All sections of
Br&#257;hmans closely follow the Grihya S&#363;tras relating to their
s&#257;kha. The marriage ceremonies commence with the Nischyathartham
or betrothal ceremony. The bridegroom being seated on a plank amidst a
number of Br&#257;hmans, V&#275;dic verses are repeated, and, after the
bestowal of blessings, the bride&rsquo;s father proclaims that he
intends giving his daughter in marriage to the bridegroom, and that he
may come for the purpose after the completion of the Vratam ceremony.
For this ceremony, the bridegroom, after being shaved, dresses up.
Meanwhile, the Br&#257;hmans who have been invited assemble. The
bridegroom sits on the marriage dais, and, after repeating certain
V&#275;dic verses, says:&mdash;&ldquo;With <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>the
permission of all assembled, let me begin the Vratams
Pr&#257;j&#257;pathyam, Soumyam, &#256;gn&#275;yam, and
Vaiswad&#275;vam, and let me also close them.&rdquo; All the Vratams
should be performed long before the marriage. In practice, however,
this is not done, so the bridegroom performs an expiatory ceremony, to
make up for the omission. This consists in offering oblations of
gh&#299;, and giving presents of money to a few Br&#257;hmans. The
bridegroom is helped throughout the Vratam ceremonies by a spiritual
teacher or guru, who is usually his father or a near relation. The guru
sprinkles water over the bridegroom&rsquo;s body, and tells him to go
on with k&#257;ndarishi tharpanam (offerings of water, gingelly, and
rice, as an oblation to Rishis). A small copper or silver vessel is
placed on a leaf to the north-east of the sacred fire, and is made to
represent Varuna. A new cloth is placed round the vessel. The various
Vratams mentioned are gone through rapidly, and consist of offerings of
gh&#299; through fire to the various D&#275;vatas and Pitris. The
N&#257;ndhi Sr&#257;dh, or memorial service to ancestors, is then
performed. The bridegroom next dresses up as a married man, and
proceeds on a mock pilgrimage to a distant place. This is called
Parad&#275;sa Pravesam (going to a foreign place), or K&#257;siyatra
(pilgrimage to Benares). It is a remnant of the Sn&#257;thakarma rite,
whereat a Brahmach&#257;ri, or student, leaves his spiritual
teacher&rsquo;s house at the close of his studies, performs a ceremony
of ablution, and becomes an initiated householder or Sn&#257;thaka. The
bridegroom carries with him an umbrella, a fan, and a bundle containing
some rice, cocoanut, and areca-nut. He usually goes eastward. His
future father-in-law meets him, and brings him to the house at which
the marriage is to be celebrated. As soon as he has arrived there, the
bride is brought, dressed up and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280"
href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>decorated in finery. The
bridal pair are taken up on the shoulders of their maternal uncles, who
dance about for a short time. Whenever they meet, the bride and
bridegroom exchange garlands (m&#257;laim&#257;ththal). The couple then
sit on a swing within the pandal (booth), and songs are sung. A few
married women go round them three times, carrying water, a light,
fruits, and betel, in a tray. The pair are conducted into the house,
and are seated on the marriage dais. The marriage, or Viv&#257;ham, is
then commenced. A pur&#333;hit (priest) repeats certain V&#275;dic
texts as a blessing, and says:&mdash;&ldquo;Bless this couple of ...
g&#333;tras, the son and daughter of ..., grandchildren of ..., now
about to be married.&rdquo; At this stage, the g&#333;tras of the
contracting couple must be pronounced distinctly, so as to ensure that
they are not among the prohibited degrees. The bridal couple must
belong to different g&#333;tras. The bridegroom next says that he is
about to commence the worship of Visvaks&#275;na if he is a
Vaishnavite, or Ganapathi if he is a Saivite, for the successful
termination of the marriage ceremonies. The Ankurarpana (seed-pan)
ceremony is then proceeded with. Five earthenware pans are procured,
and, after being purified by the sprinkling of puny&#257;ham water over
them, are arranged in the form of a square. Four of the pans are placed
at the four cardinal points, east, west, north, and south, and the
remaining pot is set down in the centre of the square. The pan to the
east represents Indra, the one to the west Varuna, the one to the south
Yama, and the one to the north S&#333;man. While water is being
sprinkled over the pans, the following synonyms for each of these gods
are repeated:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Indra&mdash;Sathakruthu, Vajranam, Sachipathi.</p>
<p class="line">Yama&mdash;Vaivaswata, Pithrupathi, Dharmar&#257;ja.

<p>Nine kinds of grains soaked in water are placed in the seed-pans.
These grains are <i lang="la-x-bio">Dolichos Lablab</i> (two
varieties), <i lang="la-x-bio">Phaseolus Mungo</i> (two varieties),
<i lang="la-x-bio">Oryza sativa</i>, <i lang="la-x-bio">Cicer
Arietinum</i>, <i lang="la-x-bio">Cajanus indicus</i>, <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Eleusine Coracana</i>, and <i lang="la-x-bio">Vigna
Catiang</i>. The tying of the wrist-thread (pratisaram) is next
proceeded with. Two cotton threads are laid on a vessel representing
Varuna. After the recitation of V&#275;dic verses, the bridegroom takes
one of the threads, and, dipping it in turmeric paste, holds it with
his left thumb, smears some of the paste on it with his right thumb and
forefinger, and ties it on the left wrist of the bride. The
pur&#333;hit ties the other thread on the right wrist of the
bridegroom, who, facing the assembly, says &ldquo;I am going to take
the bride.&rdquo; He then recites the following V&#275;dic
verse:&mdash;&ldquo;Go to my future father-in-law with due precautions,
and mingle with the members of his family. This marriage is sure to be
pleasing to Indra, because he gets oblations of food, etc., after the
marriage. May your path be smooth and free from thorns. May S&#363;rya
and Bhaga promote our dh&#257;mpathyam (companionship).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pur&#333;hit again proclaims the marriage, and the g&#333;tras
and names of three generations are repeated. Those assembled then bless
the couple. The bride&rsquo;s father says that he is prepared to give
his daughter in marriage to the bridegroom, who states that he accepts
her. The father of the bride washes the feet of the bridegroom placed
on a tray with milk and water. The bridegroom then washes the feet of
the bride&rsquo;s father. The bride sits in her father&rsquo;s lap, and
her mother stands at her side. The father, repeating the names of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s ancestors for three generations, says <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>that
he is giving his daughter to him. He places the hand of the bride on
that of the bridegroom, and both he and the bride&rsquo;s mother pour
water over the united hands of the contracting couple. The following
sl&#333;ka is repeated:&mdash;&ldquo;I am giving you a virgin decorated
with jewels, to enable me to obtain religious merit.&rdquo; The
bridegroom takes the bride by the hand, and both take their seats in
front of the sacred fire. This part of the ceremonial is called
dh&#257;re (pouring of water). Much importance is attached to it by
Tulu Br&#257;hmans. Among Non-Br&#257;hman castes in South Canara, it
forms the binding portion of the marriage ceremony. After the pouring
of gh&#299; as an oblation, the bridegroom throws down a few twigs of
dharbha grass, and repeats the formula:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! dharbha, thou
art capable of giving royal powers, and the teacher&rsquo;s seat. May I
not be separated from thee.&rdquo; Then the bride&rsquo;s father,
giving a vessel of water, says &ldquo;Here is Arghya water.&rdquo; The
bridegroom receives it with the formula:&mdash;&ldquo;May this water
destroy my enemies. May brilliancy, energy, strength, life, renown,
glory, splendour, and power dwell in me.&rdquo; Once again the
bride&rsquo;s father washes the feet of the bridegroom, who salutes his
father-in-law, saying &ldquo;Oh! water, unite me with fame, splendour,
and milk. Make me beloved by all creatures, the lord of cattle. May
fame, heroism, and energy dwell in me.&rdquo; The bride&rsquo;s father
pours some water from a vessel over the hand of the bridegroom, who
says &ldquo;To the ocean I send you, the imperishable waters; go back
to your source. May I not suffer loss in my offspring. May my sap not
be shed.&rdquo; A mixture of honey, plantain fruit, and gh&#299;, is
given to the bridegroom by the bride&rsquo;s father with the words
&ldquo;Ayam Madhuparko&rdquo; (honey mixture). Receiving it, the
bridegroom mutters the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href=
"#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>following:&mdash;&ldquo;What is
the honeyed, highest form of honey which consists in the enjoyment of
food; by that honeyed highest form of honey, may I become highest,
honeyed, an enjoyer of food.&rdquo; He partakes three times of the
mixture, and says:&mdash;&ldquo;I eat thee for the sake of brilliancy,
luck, glory, power, and the enjoyment of food.&rdquo; Then the
bride&rsquo;s father gives a cocoanut to the bridegroom, saying
&ldquo;Gauhu&rdquo; (cow). The bridegroom receives it with the words
&ldquo;Oh! cow, destroy my sin, and that of my father-in-law.&rdquo;
According to the Grihya S&#363;tras, a cow should be presented to the
bridegroom, to be cooked or preserved. Next a plantain fruit is given
to the bridegroom, who, after eating a small portion of it, hands it to
the bride. The bride sits on a heap or bundle of paddy (unhusked rice),
and the bridegroom says &ldquo;Oh! Varuna, bless her with wealth. May
there be no ill-feeling between herself, her brothers and sisters. Oh!
Brihaspathi, bless her that she may not lose her husband. Oh! Indra,
bless her to be fertile. Oh! Savitha, bless her that she may be happy
in all respects. Oh! girl, be gentle-eyed and friendly to me. Let your
look be of such a nature as not to kill your husband. Be kind to me,
and to my brothers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12366src" href=
"#xd21e12366" name="xd21e12366src">88</a> May you shine with lustre,
and be of good repute. Live long, and bear living children.&rdquo; The
pair are then seated, and the bridegroom, taking a blade of dharbha
grass, passes it between the eyebrows of the bride, and throws it
behind her, saying &ldquo;With this dharbha grass I remove the evil
influence of any bad mark thou mayst possess, which is likely to cause
widowhood.&rdquo; [Certain marks or curls (suli) forebode prosperity,
and others misery to a family into which a girl enters <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>by
marriage. And, when a wealthy Hindu meditates purchasing a horse, he
looks to the presence or absence of certain marks on particular parts
of the body, and thereby forms a judgment of the temper and qualities
of the animal.] The bridegroom then repeats the
following:&mdash;&ldquo;Now they ought to rejoice, and not cry. They
have arranged our union to bring happiness to both of us. In view of
the happiness we are to enjoy hereafter, they should be glad. This is a
fitting occasion for rejoicing.&rdquo; Four Br&#257;hmans next bring
water, and the bridegroom receives it, saying:&mdash;&ldquo;May the
evil qualities of this water disappear; may it increase. Let the
Br&#257;hmans bring water for the bath, and may it bring long life and
children to her.&rdquo; A bundle of paddy, or a basket filled
therewith, is brought to the pandal. The bride sits on the paddy, and a
ring of dharbha grass is placed on her head. The bridegroom repeats the
formula &ldquo;Blessed by the S&#363;rya, sit round the sacred fire,
and look at the dharbha ring, my mother-in-law and
brother-in-law.&rdquo; A yoke is then brought, one end of which is
placed on the head of the bride above the ring, and the following
formula is repeated:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! Indra, cleanse and purify this
girl, just as you did in the case of Abhala, by pouring water through
three holes before marrying her.&rdquo; Abhala was an ugly woman, who
wished to marry Indra. To attain this end, she did penance for a long
time, and, meeting Indra, requested him to fulfil her desire. Indra
made her his wife, after transforming her into a beautiful woman by
sprinkling water over her through the holes in the wheels of the car
which was his vehicle. Into the hole of the yoke a gold coin, or the
t&#257;li (marriage badge), is dropped, with the words &ldquo;May this
gold prove a blessing to you. May the yoke, the hole of the yoke, bring
happiness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>to you. May we be blessed to unite your body
with mine.&rdquo; Then the bridegroom, sprinkling water over the yoke
and coin, says:&mdash;&ldquo;May you become purified by the sun through
this purificatory water. May this water, which is the cause of thunder
and lightning, bring happiness to you. Oh! girl, may this water give
you health and long life. A new and costly silk cloth (k&#363;rai),
purchased by the bridegroom, is given to the bride, and the bridegroom
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! Indra, listen to my prayers; accept them, and
fulfil my desires.&rdquo; The bride puts on the cloth, with the
assistance of the bridegroom&rsquo;s sister, and sits on her
father&rsquo;s lap. The bridegroom, taking up the t&#257;li, ties it by
the string on the bride&rsquo;s neck, saying:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! girl, I
am tying the t&#257;li to secure religious merit.&rdquo; This is not a
V&#275;dic verse, and this part of the ceremony is not included in the
Grihya S&#363;tras. All the Br&#257;hmans assembled bless the couple by
throwing rice over their heads. A dharbha waist-cord is passed round
the waist of the bride, and the following is
repeated:&mdash;&ldquo;This girl is gazing at Agni, wishing for health,
wealth, strength and children. I am binding her for her good.&rdquo;
The bridegroom then holds the hand of the bride, and both go to the
sacred fire, where the former says:&mdash;&ldquo;Let S&#363;rya lead to
Agni, and may you obtain permission from the Aswins to do so. Go with
me to my house. Be my wife, and the mistress of my house. Instruct and
help me in the performance of sacrifices.&rdquo; After offerings of
gh&#299; in the sacred fire, the bridegroom
says:&mdash;&ldquo;S&#333;ma was your husband; Gandharva knew thee
next; Agni was your third husband. I, son of man, am your fourth
husband. S&#333;ma gave you to Gandharva, and Gandharva gave you to
Agni, who gave to me with progeny and wealth.&rdquo; The bridegroom
takes hold of the bride&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286"
href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>right wrist, and, pressing on
the fingers, passes his hand over the united fingers three times. This
is called P&#257;nigrahanam. To the Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hman this is
a very important item, being the binding part of the marriage
ceremonial. Some years ago, at a village near Chalakkudi in the Cochin
State, a Namb&#363;tiri refused to accept a girl as his bride, because
the pur&#333;hit inadvertently grasped her fingers, to show how it
ought to be done at the time of the marriage ceremony. The pur&#333;hit
had to marry the girl himself. The next item in the ceremonial is
Sapthapathi, or the taking of the seven steps. This is considered as
the most binding portion thereof. The bridegroom lifts the left foot of
the bride seven times, repeating the following:&mdash;&ldquo;One step
for sap, may Vishnu go after thee. Two steps for juice, may Vishnu go
after thee. Three steps for vows, may Vishnu go after thee. Four steps
for comfort, may Vishnu go after thee. Five steps for cattle, may
Vishnu go after thee. Six steps for the prospering of wealth, may
Vishnu go after thee. Seven steps for the seven-fold
h&#333;triship,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12376src" href="#xd21e12376"
name="xd21e12376src">89</a> may Vishnu go after thee. With seven steps
we have become companions. May I attain to friendship with thee. May I
not be separated from thy friendship. Mayst thou not be separated from
my friendship. Let us be united; let us always take counsel together
with good hearts and mutual love. May we grow in strength and
prosperity together. Now we are one in minds, deeds, and desires. Thou
art Rik, I am S&#257;mam; I am the sky, thou art the earth; I am the
semen, thou art the bearer; I am the mind, thou art the tongue. Follow
me faithfully, that we may have wealth and children together. Come thou
of sweet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>speech.&rdquo; The bridegroom then does
h&#333;mam, repeating the following:&mdash;&ldquo;We are offering
oblations to S&#333;ma, Gandharva, and Agni. This girl has just passed
her virginity. Make her leave her father&rsquo;s house. Bless her to
remain fixed in her husband&rsquo;s house. May she have a good son by
your blessing. Cause her to beget ten children, and I shall be the
eleventh child. Oh! Agni, bless her with children, and make them
long-lived. Oh! Varuna, I pray to you for the same thing. May this
woman be freed from the sorrow arising out of sterility, and be blessed
by Garhapathy&#257;gni. May she have a number of children in her, and
become the mother of many living children. Oh! girl, may your house
never know lamentations during nights caused by deaths. May you live
long and happy with your husband and children. May the sky protect thy
back; may V&#257;yu strengthen your thighs; and the Aswins your breast.
May Savitri look after thy suckling sons. Until the garment is put on,
may Brihaspathi guard them, and the Viswed&#275;vas afterwards. Oh!
Varuna, make me strong and healthy. Do not steal away years from our
ages. All those who offer oblations pray for the same. Oh! you
all-pervading Agni, pacify Varuna; you who blaze forth into flames to
receive oblations, be friendly towards us. Be near us, and protect us.
Receive, and be satisfied with our oblations. Make us prosperous. We
are always thinking of you. Take our oblations to the several
d&#275;vatas, and give us medicine.&rdquo; The bride next treads on a
stone, and the bridegroom says:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! girl, tread on this
stone. Be firm like it. Destroy those who seek to do thee harm.
Overcome thy enemies.&rdquo; Some fried paddy is put in the sacred
fire, and the bridegroom repeats the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! Agni,
I am offering the fried grains, so that this girl may be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>blessed with long life. Oh! Agni, give me my
wife with children, just as in olden days you were given S&#363;ryayi
with wealth. Oh! Agni, bless my wife with lustre and longevity. Also
bless her husband with long life, that she may live happily. Oh! Agni,
help us to overcome our enemies.&rdquo; Again the bride treads on the
stone, and the bridegroom says:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! girl, tread on this
stone, and be firm like it. Destroy those who seek to do thee harm.
Overcome thy enemies.&rdquo; This is followed by the offering of fried
grain with the following formula:&mdash;&ldquo;The virgins prayed to
S&#363;rya and Agni to secure husbands, and they were at once granted
their boons. Such an Agni is now being propitiated by offerings of
fried paddy. Let him make the bride leave her father&rsquo;s
house.&rdquo; For the third time, the bride treads on the stone, and
fried paddy is offered with the formula:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! Agni, thou
art the giver of life, and receiver of oblations. Oblations of gh&#299;
are now offered to you. Bless the pair to be of one mind.&rdquo; The
dharbha girdle is removed from the bride&rsquo;s waist, with the verse:
&ldquo;I am loosening you from the bondage of Varuna. I am now removing
the thread with which S&#363;rya bound you.&rdquo; Those assembled then
disperse. Towards evening, Br&#257;hmans again assemble, and the bride
and bridegroom sit before the sacred fire, while the former repeat
several V&#275;dic riks. They are supposed to start for their home,
driving in a carriage, and the verses repeated have reference to the
chariot, horses, boats, etc. After gh&#299; has been poured into the
fire, a child, who should be a male who has not lost brothers or
sisters, is seated in the lap of the bride, and the bridegroom
says:&mdash;&ldquo;May cows, horses, men, and wealth, increase in this
house. Let this child occupy your lap, just as the S&#333;ma creeper
which gives strength <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289"
name="pb289">289</a>]</span>to the D&#275;vatas occupies the regions of
the stars.&rdquo; Giving some plantain fruit to the child, the
bridegroom says:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! fruits, ye bear seeds. May my wife
bear seeds likewise by your blessing.&rdquo; Then the pair are shown
Druva and Arundathi (the pole star and Ursa major), which are
worshipped with the words:&mdash;&ldquo;The seven Rishis who have led
to firmness, she, Arundathi, who stands first among the six Krithikas
(Pleiads), may she the eighth one, who leads the conjunction of the
(moon with the) six Krithikas, the first (among conjunctions) shine
upon us. Firm dwelling, firm origin; the firm one art thou, standing on
the side of firmness. Thou art the pillar of the stars. Thus protect me
against my adversaries.&rdquo; They then proceed to perform the
Sth&#257;lip&#257;ka ceremony, in which the bride should cook some
rice, which the bridegroom offers as an oblation in the sacred fire. In
practice, however, a little food is brought, and placed in the fire
without being cooked. The pur&#333;hit decorates a <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Ficus</i> stick with dharbha grass, and gives it to the
bridegroom. It is placed in the roof, or somewhere within the house,
near the seed-pans. [According to the Grihya S&#363;tras, the couple
ought to occupy the same mat, with the stick between them. This is not
in vogue amongst several sections of Br&#257;hmans. The Mysore
Carnatakas, Mandya Aiyangars, and Shivallis, observe a kindred
ceremony. Amongst the Mandyas, for example, on the fourth night of the
marriage rites, the bridal couple occupy the same mat for a short time,
and a stick is placed between them. The Pajamadm&#275;, or mat
marriage, amongst the Shivalli Br&#257;hmans, evidently refers to this
custom.] On the second and third days of the marriage ceremonies,
h&#333;mams are performed in the morning and evening, and the nalagu
ceremony is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>performed. In this, the couple are seated on two
planks covered with mats and cloth, amidst a large number of women
assembled within the pandal. In front of them, betel leaves, areca
nuts, fruits, flowers, and turmeric paste are placed in a tray. The
women sing songs which they have learnt from childhood, and the bride
also sings the praises of the bridegroom. Taking a little of the
turmeric paste rendered red by the addition of chunam (lime), she makes
marks by drawing lines over the feet (nalangu idal). The ceremony
closes with the waving of &#257;r&#257;thi (water coloured red with
turmeric and chunam), and the distribution of p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri
(betel leaves and areca nuts). The waving is done by two women, who
sing appropriate songs. On the fourth day, Br&#257;hmans assemble, and
the pair are seated in their midst. After the recitation of V&#275;dic
verses, the contracting couple are blessed. A small quantity of
turmeric paste, reddened by the addition of chunam, is mixed with
gh&#299;, and smeared over the shoulders of the pair, and a mark is
made on their foreheads. This is called Pachchai Kaly&#257;nam, and is
peculiar to Tamil Br&#257;hmans, both Smarthas and Vaishnavas. Amongst
Tamil Br&#257;hmans, prominence is given to the maternal uncles on the
fourth day. The bride and bridegroom are carried astride on the
shoulders of their uncles, who dance to the strains of a band. When
they meet, the couple exchange garlands (malaim&#257;ththal). Towards
evening, a procession is got up at the expense of the maternal uncle of
the bride, and is hence called Amm&#257;n K&#333;lam. The bride is
dressed up as a boy, and another girl is dressed up to represent the
bride. They are taken in procession through the streets, and, on their
return, the pseudo-bridegroom is made to speak to the real bridegroom
in somewhat insolent tones, and some mock play is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>indulged in. The real bridegroom is addressed as
if he was the syce (groom) or gumastha (clerk) of the
pseudo-bridegroom, and is sometimes treated as a thief, and judgment
passed on him by the latter. Among Sri Vaishnavas, after the Pachchai
smearing ceremony, the bridal couple roll a cocoanut to and fro across
the dais, and the assembled Br&#257;hmans chant stanzas in Tamil
composed by a Vaishnava lady named &#256;ndal, an avatar of Lakshmi,
who dedicated herself to Vishnu. In these stanzas, she narrates to her
attendants the dream, in which she went through the marriage ceremony
after her dedication to the god. P&#257;n-sup&#257;ri, of which a
little, together with some money, is set apart for &#256;ndal, is then
distributed to all present. A large crowd generally assembles, as it is
believed that the chanting of &#256;ndal&rsquo;s srisukthi (praise of
Lakshmi) brings a general blessing. The family priest calls out the
names and g&#333;tras of those who have become related to the bride and
bridegroom through their marriage. As each person&rsquo;s name is
called out, he or she is supposed to make a present of cloths, money,
etc., to the bridegroom or bride. [The Telugu and Carnataka
Br&#257;hmans, instead of the Pachchai Kaly&#257;nam, perform a
ceremony called N&#257;gavali on the fourth or fifth day. Thirty-two
lights and two vessels, representing Siva and Parvathi, are arranged in
the form of a square. Unbleached thread, soaked in turmeric paste, is
passed round the square, and tied to the pandal. The bridal couple sit
in front of the square, and, after doing p&#363;ja (worship), cut the
thread, and take their seats within the square. The bridegroom ties a
t&#257;li of black glass beads on the bride&rsquo;s neck, in the
presence of 33 crores (330 millions) of gods, represented by a number
of small pots arranged round the square. Close to the pots are the
figures of two elephants, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href=
"#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>designed in rice grains and salt
respectively. After going round the pots, the couple separate, and the
bridegroom stands by the salt elephant, and the bride by the other.
They then talk about the money value of the two animals, and an
altercation takes place, during which they again go round the pots, and
stand, the bridegroom near the rice elephant, and the bride near the
salt one. The bargaining as to the price of the animals is renewed, and
the couple go round the pots once more. This ceremony is followed by a
burlesque of domestic life. The bride is presented with two wooden
dolls from Tirupati, and told to make a cradle out of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s turmeric-coloured cloth, which he wore on the
t&#257;li-tying day. The couple converse on domestic matters, and the
bridegroom asks the bride to attend to her household affairs, so that
he may go to his duties. She pleads her inability to do so because of
the children, and asks him to take charge of them. She then shows the
babies (dolls) to all present, and a good deal of fun is made out of
the incident. The bride, with her mother standing by her side near two
empty chairs, is then introduced to her new relations by marriage, who
sit in pairs on the chairs, and make presents of p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri
and turmeric.] On the fifth day of the marriage ceremonies, before
dawn, the bridal couple are seated on the dais, and the Gandharva stick
is removed, with the words:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! Visv&#257;wasu Gandharva,
I pray to you to make this girl my wife. Unite her with me. Leave her,
and seek another.&rdquo; The bridegroom then performs h&#333;mams. A
coin is placed on the bride&rsquo;s head, and a little gh&#299; put
thereon. Gazing at the bridegroom, she says:&mdash;&ldquo;With a loving
heart I regard thee who knowest my heart. Thou art radiant with tapas
(penance). Fill me with a child, and this house of ours <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>with
wealth. Thou art desirous of a son. Thus shalt thou reproduce
thyself.&rdquo; Looking at the bride, the bridegroom then
says:&mdash;&ldquo;I see thee radiant and eager to be filled with child
by me. Thou art in thy youth now. Enjoy me, therefore, while I am over
you, and so reproduce thyself, being desirous of a son.&rdquo; Touching
the bride&rsquo;s breasts with his ring-finger, and then touching his
heart, he repeats the following:&mdash;&ldquo;May the Viswe gods unite
our hearts; may the water unite our hearts; may V&#257;yu and Brahma
unite our hearts; and may Sarasvati teach us both conversation
appropriate to this occasion of our intercourse.&rdquo; More V&#275;dic
riks are then recited, as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Thou Praj&#257;pathi,
enter my body that I may have vigour during this act; so thou Thvastri,
who fashionest forms with Vishnu and other gods; so thou Indra, who
grantest boons with thy friends the Viswed&#275;vas, by thy blessing
may we have many sons. May Vishnu make thy womb ready; may Thvashtri
frame the shape (of the child); may Praj&#257;pathi pour forth (the
sperm); may Dhatri give thee conception. Give conception,
Siniv&#257;li; give conception, Sarasvati. May the two Asvins, wreathed
with lotus, give conception to thee. The embryo which the two Asvins
produce with their golden kindling sticks, that embryo we call into thy
womb, that thou mayst give birth to it after ten months. As the earth
is pregnant with Agni, as the heaven is pregnant with Indra, as
V&#257;yu dwells in the womb of the regions (of the earth), thus I
place an embryo in thy womb. Open thy womb; take in the sperm. May a
male child, an embryo, be begotten in the womb. The mother bears him
ten months, may he be born, the most valiant of his kin. May a male
embryo enter the womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a man be born here,
thy son, after ten <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294"
name="pb294">294</a>]</span>months. I do with thee (the work) that is
sacred to Praj&#257;pathi; may an embryo enter the womb. May a child be
born without deficiency, with all its limbs, not blind, not lame, not
sucked out by Pis&#257;chas&rdquo; (devils). The marriage is brought to
a close, after this recitation, with the presentation of fruits, etc.,
to all the Br&#257;hmans assembled, and to all relations, children
included. The bridegroom chews betel for the first time on this day.
The wrist-threads are removed, and the seed-pans containing the
seedlings, which have been worshipped daily, are taken in procession to
a tank (pond), into which the seedlings are thrown.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that prayers for male issue are of frequent
occurrence during the marriage ceremonial. In Sanskrit works, Putra
(son) is defined as one who delivers a parent from a hell called put.
It is generally believed that the welfare of a parent&rsquo;s soul
depends on the performance of sr&#257;dh (memorial services) by his
son. It was laid down by Manu that a man is perfect, when he consists
of three&mdash;himself, his wife, and his son. In the Rig V&#275;da it
is stated that &ldquo;when a father sees the face of a living son, he
pays a debt in him, and gains immortality. The pleasure which a father
has in his son exceeds all other enjoyments. His wife is a friend, his
daughter an object of companion, his son shines as his light in the
highest world.&rdquo; The following story of a certain pious man of
ascetical temperament, who determined to shirk the religious duty of
taking a wife, is narrated by Monier Williams:&mdash;&ldquo;Quietly
skipping over the second prescribed period of life, during which he
ought to have been a householder (grihastha), he entered at once upon
the third period&mdash;that is to say, he became an ascetic, abjured
all female society, and retired to the woods. Wandering about one day,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>absorbed in meditation, he was startled by an
extraordinary spectacle. He saw before him a deep and apparently
bottomless pit. Around its edge some unhappy men were hanging suspended
by ropes of grass, at which here and there a rat was nibbling. On
asking their history, he discovered to his horror that they were his
own ancestors compelled to hang in this unpleasant manner, and doomed
eventually to fall into the abyss, unless he went back into the world,
did his duty like a man, married a suitable wife, and had a son, who
would be able to release them from their critical predicament.&rdquo;
This legend is recorded in detail in the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata.</p>
<p>A curious mock marriage ceremony is celebrated amongst Br&#257;hmans
when an individual marries a third wife. It is believed that a third
marriage is very inauspicious, and that the bride will become a widow.
To prevent this mishap, the man is made to marry the arka plant
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Calotropis gigantea</i>), and the real marriage
thus becomes the fourth. If this ceremony is carried on in orthodox
fashion, it is generally celebrated on some Sunday or Monday, when the
constellation Astham is visible. The bridegroom and a Br&#257;hman
priest, accompanied by a third Br&#257;hman, repair to a spot where the
arka plant (a very common weed) is growing. The plant is decorated with
a cloth and a piece of string, and symbolised into the sun. The
bridegroom then invokes it thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! master of three
l&#333;ks, Oh! the seven-horsed, Oh! R&#257;vi, avert the evils of the
third marriage.&rdquo; Next the plant is addressed with the
words:&mdash;&ldquo;You are the oldest of the plants of this world.
Brahma created you to save such of us as have to marry a third time, so
please become my wife.&rdquo; The Br&#257;hman who accompanies the
bridegroom becomes his father-in-law for the moment, and says to
him:&mdash;&ldquo;I give you in marriage <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>Aditya&rsquo;s great
grand-daughter, Savi&rsquo;s grand-daughter, and my daughter
Arkakanya.&rdquo; All the ceremonies, such as making h&#333;mam,
t&#257;li-tying, etc., are performed as at a regular marriage, and,
after the recitation of a few sentences from the V&#275;das, the plant
is cut down. &ldquo;The plant,&rdquo; Mr. A. Srinivasan
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12410src" href="#xd21e12410" name=
"xd21e12410src">90</a> &ldquo;is named arka after the sun. When the car
of the sun turns towards the north, every Hindu applies the leaves of
this plant to his head before he bathes, in honour of the event. The
plant is, besides, believed to be a willing scapegoat to others&rsquo;
ills. Oil and gh&#299; applied to the head of the victim of persistent
illness has only to be transferred to this plant, when it withers and
saves the man, even as Baber is said to have saved his son. The poet
Kalid&#257;sa describes sweet Sakuntala, born of a shaggy dweller of
the forest, as a garland of jasmine thrown on an arka plant. &lsquo;May
the arka grow luxuriant in your house&rsquo; is the commonest form of
curse. &lsquo;Be thou belaboured with arka leaves&rsquo; is familiar in
the mouths of reprimanding mothers. Adulterers were, half a century
ago, seated on an ass, face to the tail, and marched through the
village. The public disgrace was enhanced by placing a garland of the
despised arka leaves on their head. [Uppiliyan women convicted of
immorality are said to be garlanded with arka flowers, and made to
carry a basket of mud round the village.] A Telugu proverb asks
&lsquo;Does the bee ever seek the arka flower?&rsquo; The reasons for
the ill-repute that this plant suffers from are not at all clear. The
fact that it has a partiality for wastes has evidently brought on its
devoted head the dismal associations of desolation, but there would
seem to be more deep-seated hatred to the plant than has been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>explained.&rdquo; A Tamil proverb has it that he
who crushes the bud of the arka earns merit. Some Telugu and Canarese
Br&#257;hmans, who follow the Yajur V&#275;da or Rig V&#275;da,
consider the arka plant as sacred, and use the leaves thereof during
the n&#257;ndhi (ancestor invoking) ceremony, which is performed as one
of the marriage rites. Two or three arka leaves, with betel leaves and
areca nuts, are tied to the cloth, which is attached to a stick as
representing the ancestors (pithrus). With some the arka leaves are
replaced by leaves of <i>Pongamia glabra</i>. On rathasapthami day (the
seventh day after the new moon in the month &#256;vani), an orthodox
Hindu should bathe his head and shoulders with arka leaves in
propitiation of S&#363;rya (the sun). Br&#257;hmans who follow the
S&#257;ma V&#275;da, during the annual up&#257;karmam ceremony, make
use of arka leaves and flowers in worshipping the Rishis and Pithrus.
On the up&#257;karmam day, the S&#257;ma V&#275;dis invoke their
sixty-two Rishis and the last three ancestors, who are represented by
sixty-five clay balls placed on arka leaves. To them are offered arka
flowers, fruits of karai-chedi (<i>Canthium parviflorum</i>), and
n&#257;val (<i>Eugenia Jambolana</i>). In addition to this worship,
they perform the Rishi and Pithru tharpanam by offering water, gingelly
(<i>Sesamum indicum</i>) seeds, and rice. The celebrant, prior to
dipping his hand into the water, places in his hands two arka leaves,
gingelly, and rice. The juice of the arka plant is a favourite agent in
the hands of suicides. Among the Tangal&#257;n Paraiyans, if a young
man dies before he is married, a ceremony called kannikazhithal
(removing bachelorhood) is performed. Before the corpse is laid on the
bier, a garland of arka flowers is placed round its neck, and balls of
mud from a gutter are laid on the head, knees, and other parts of the
body. In some places a variant of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb298" href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>ceremony consists in
the erection of a mimic marriage booth, which is covered with leaves of
the arka plant, flowers of which are also placed round the neck as a
garland. At a form of marriage called rambha or kathali (plantain)
marriage, the arka plant is replaced by a plantain tree (<i>Musa</i>).
It is performed by those who happen to be eldest brothers, and who are
incapable of getting married, so as to give a chance to younger
brothers, who are not allowed to marry unless the elder brother or
brothers are already married.</p>
<p>At the present day, many Hindus disregard certain ceremonies, in the
celebration of which their forefathers were most scrupulous. Even the
daily ceremonial ablutions, which are all important to a Br&#257;hman
from a sh&#257;straic point of view, are now neglected by a large
majority, and the prayers (mantrams), which should be chanted during
their performance, are forgotten. But no Br&#257;hman, orthodox or
unorthodox, dares to abandon the death ceremonial, and annual
sr&#257;dh (memorial rites). A Br&#257;hman beggar, when soliciting
alms, invariably pleads that he has to perform his father or
mother&rsquo;s sr&#257;dh, or upanayanam (thread ceremony) of his
children, and he rarely goes away empty-handed. &ldquo;The constant
periodical performance,&rdquo; Monier Williams writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12435src" href="#xd21e12435" name=
"xd21e12435src">91</a> &ldquo;of commemorative obsequies is regarded in
the light of a positive and peremptory obligation. It is the simple
discharge of a solemn debt to one&rsquo;s forefathers, a debt
consisting not only in reverential homage, but in the performance of
acts necessary to their support, happiness, and progress onwards in the
spiritual world. A man&rsquo;s deceased relatives, for at least three
generations, are among his cherished divinities, and must be honoured
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>by daily offerings and adoration, or a nemesis
of some kind is certain to overtake his living family. The object of a
Hindu funeral is nothing less than the investiture of the departed
spirit with an intermediate gross body&mdash;a peculiar frame
interposed, as it were parenthetically, between the terrestrial gross
body, which has just been destroyed by fire, and the new terrestrial
body, which it is compelled to ultimately assume. The creation of such
an intervenient frame, composed of gross elements, though less gross
than those of earth, becomes necessary, because the individualised
spirit of man, after the cremation of the terrestrial body, has nothing
left to withhold it from re-absorption into the universal soul, except
its incombustible subtle body, which, as composed of the subtle
elements, is not only proof against the fire of the funeral pile, but
is incapable of any sensations in the temporary heaven, or temporary
hell, through one or other of which every separate human spirit is
forced to pass before returning to earth, and becoming re-invested with
a terrestrial gross body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a Br&#257;hman is on the point of death, he is removed from his
bed, and laid on the floor. If there is any fear of the day being a
danishtapanchami (inauspicious), the dying man is taken out of the
house, and placed in the court-yard or pial (raised verandah). Some
prayers are uttered, and a cow is presented (g&#333;dhanam). These are
intended to render the passage of life through the various parts of the
body as easy as possible. The spirit is supposed to escape through one
of the nine orifices of the body, according to the character of the
individual concerned. That of a good man leaves the body through the
brahmarandhra (top of the skull), and that of a bad man through the
anus. Immediately after death, the body is washed, religious marks are
made on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>the forehead, and parched paddy and betel are
scattered over and around it by the son. As a Br&#257;hman is supposed
always to have his fire with him, the sacred fire is lighted. At this
stage, certain purificatory ceremonies are performed, if death has
taken place on a day or hour of evil omen, or at midnight. Next, a
little cooked rice is cooked in a new earthen pot, and a new cloth is
thrown over the corpse, which is roused by the recitation of mantrams.
Four bearers, to each of whom dharbha grass is given in token of his
office, are selected to carry the corpse to the burning-ground. The
eldest son, who is the funeral celebrant, and his brothers are shaved.
On ordinary occasions, brothers should not be shaved on the same day,
as this would be inauspicious. They are only shaved on the same day on
the occasion of the death of their father or mother. The widow of the
deceased, and female relations, go three times round the corpse, before
it is placed on the bier. Very often, at this stage, all the women
present set up a loud lamentation, and repeat the death songs.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12444src" href="#xd21e12444" name=
"xd21e12444src">92</a> If the dead person was a respected elder,
special professional women, trained as mourners, are engaged. I am
informed that, in the Coimbatore district, and amongst the
Sathyamangalam Brahacharanams, there are certain widows who are
professional mourners. As soon as they hear of the death of an elder,
they repair to the house, and worry the bereaved family into engaging
them for a small fee. The space, which intervenes between the dead
man&rsquo;s house and the burning-ground, is divided into four parts.
When the end of the first of these is reached, the corpse is placed on
the ground, and the sons and nephews go round it, repeating mantrams.
They untie their kudumis <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href=
"#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>(hair knot), leaving part thereof
loose, tie up the rest into a small bunch, and keep on slapping their
thighs. [When children at play have their kudumi partially tied, and
slap their thighs, they are invariably scolded, owing to the
association with funerals.] A little cooked rice is offered to the path
as a pathi bali (wayside offering), to propitiate evil spirits, or
bh&#363;thas. The same ceremonial should, strictly speaking, be
performed at two other spots, but now-a-days it is the custom to place
the corpse on the ground near the funeral pyre, moving its position
three times, while the circumambulation and pathi bali are gone through
only once. As soon as the corpse has reached the spot where the pyre
is, the celebrant of the rites sprinkles water thereon, and throws a
quarter of an anna on it as the equivalent of purchase of the ground
for cremation. The sacred fire is lighted, and the right palm of the
corpse is touched with a gold coin. The nine orifices of the body are
then smeared with gh&#299;, and rice is thrown over the corpse, and
placed in its mouth. The son takes a burning brand from the sacred
fire, lights the pyre, and looks at the sun. He then carries a pot
filled with water, having a hole at the bottom through which the water
trickles out, on his shoulders three times round the corpse, and, at
the end of the third round, throws it down. Then he, and all the
relations of the deceased, squat on the ground, facing east, take up
some dharbha grass, and, cutting it into small fragments with their
nails, scatter them in the air, while repeating some V&#275;dic verses,
which are chanted very loudly and slowly, especially at the funeral of
a respected elder. The celebrant then pours a little water on a stone,
and sprinkles himself with it. This is also done by the other
relations, and they pass beneath a bundle of dharbha grass and twigs of
<i>Ficus glomerata</i> held by the pur&#333;hit (officiating
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>priest), and gaze for a moment at the sun. Once
more they sprinkle themselves with water, and proceed to a tank, where
they bathe. When they return home, two rites, called nagna (naked)
sr&#257;dh, and p&#257;sh&#257;na sth&#257;panam (stone-fixing), are
celebrated. The disembodied spirit is supposed to be naked after the
body has been cremated. To clothe it, offerings of water, with balls of
cooked rice, are made, and a cloth, lamp, and money are given to a
Br&#257;hman. Then two stones are set up, one in the house and the
other on the bank of a tank, to represent the spirit of the deceased.
For ten days, libations of water mixed with gingelly seeds, called
t&#299;lothakam, and a ball of cooked rice, must be offered to the
stones. The ball of rice is left for crows to eat. The number of
libations must be seventy-five, commencing with three on the first day,
and increasing the number daily by one. In addition, three further
libations are made daily by dipping a piece of cloth from the
winding-sheet, and rinsing it over the stone (vasothakam). On the day
after cremation, the relations assemble at the burning-ground, and the
son, after extinguishing the burning embers, removes the fragments of
bones from the ashes. The ceremony is called sanchyanam (gathering).
Cooked food is offered. The bones are thrown into some sacred river, or
buried in the ground. On the tenth day after death, a large quantity of
cooked rice (prabh&#363;thabali) is offered to the spirit of the dead
person, which is believed to grow very hungry on that day. The food is
heaped up on plantain leaves, and all the near relations go round them,
crying and beating their breasts. It is mostly females who perform this
rite, males standing aloof. The food is taken to a tank, and the widow,
decorated and dressed up, is conducted thither. The food is thrown into
the water, and, if the widow is an elderly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>orthodox woman, her t&#257;li is removed. On the
same day, her head is clean shaved. A widow is not allowed to adorn
herself with jewels and finery except on this day, when all her close
relations come and see her. If this is not done, pregnant women may not
see her for a year. All the agnates should be present on the tenth day,
and perform tharpana (oblations of water). Until this day they are
under pollution, and, after prabh&#363;thabali, they bathe, and
h&#333;mam is performed. Some ashes from the sacred fire are mixed with
gh&#299;, and a mark is made on the foreheads of those who are under
pollution, to remove it. During the period of pollution, a Sri
Vaishnava will have only a white mark without the red streak on his
forehead; a M&#257;dhva will not have the black dot; and Smarthas avoid
having marks altogether. The tenth day ceremony is called Das&#257;ham.
On the eleventh day, a ceremony called &#274;kodishtam (eleventh day
ceremony) is performed. A Br&#257;hman is seated to represent the
pr&#275;tha or dead person, and fed after going through sr&#257;dh
rites. As a rule, the man is a close relation of the deceased. But,
amongst certain classes of Br&#257;hmans, an outsider is engaged, and
well remunerated. On the twelfth day, the Sapindikaranam (sapinda,
kinsman) ceremony, which is just like the ordinary sr&#257;dh, is
performed. At the close thereof, six balls of cooked rice are offered
to three ancestors, male and female (three balls for males, and three
for females). These balls are arranged in two rows, with a space
between them. An elongated mass of food is placed between the rows, and
divided with blades of dharbha grass into three portions, which are
arranged close to the balls of rice. This is regarded as uniting the
dead man with the pitris (ancestors). A cow is usually presented just
before the union takes place, and the gift <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span>is
believed to render the crossing of the river Vaitarani (river of death)
easy for the departed soul. The Sapindikaranam is a very important
ceremony. When there is a dispute concerning division of property on
the death of an individual, the ceremony is not performed until the
parties come to an agreement. For instance, if a married man dies
without issue, and his widow&rsquo;s brothers-in-law cannot come to
terms as regards the partition of the property, the widow may refuse to
allow the performance of the ceremony. The Sapindikaranam should,
according to the sh&#257;stras, be performed a year after death,
<i>i.e.</i>, on the completion of all the M&#257;sikas (monthly
sr&#257;dhs). But, at the present day, a ceremony called Sh&#333;dasam
(the sixteen) is performed just before the Sapindikaranam on the
twelfth day. In the course of the year, twelve monthly and four
quarterly sr&#257;dhs should be performed. The Sh&#333;dasam ceremony,
which is carried out in lieu thereof, consists in giving presents of
money and vessels to sixteen Br&#257;hmans. On the twelfth day, a feast
is held, and domestic worship is carried out on a large scale. At the
close thereof, a sl&#333;ka called Charma sl&#333;ka, in praise of the
deceased, is composed and repeated by some one versed in Sanskrit.
Every month, for a year after a death in a family, sr&#257;dh should,
as indicated, be performed. This corresponds in detail with the annual
sr&#257;dh, which is regularly performed, unless a visit is paid to
Gaya, which renders further performance of the rite not obligatory. For
the performance of this ceremony by the nearest agnate of the deceased
(eldest son or other), three Br&#257;hmans should be called in, to
represent respectively Vishnu, the D&#275;vatas, and the ancestors.
Sometimes two Br&#257;hmans are made to suffice, and Vishnu is
represented by a s&#257;lagr&#257;ma stone. In extreme cases, only one
Br&#257;hman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>assists at the ceremony, the two others being
represented by dharbha grass. The sacred fire is lighted, and gh&#299;,
a small quantity of raw and cooked rice, and vegetables are offered up
in the fire. The Br&#257;hmans then wash their feet, and are fed.
Before they enter the space set apart for the meal, water, gingelly,
and rice are sprinkled about it, to keep off evil spirits. As soon as
the meal is finished, a ball of rice, called v&#257;yasa pindam
(crow&rsquo;s food), is offered to the pithru d&#275;vatas (ancestors
of three generations), and thrown to the crows. If they do not eat the
rice, the omens are considered to be unfavourable. The Br&#257;hmans
receive betel and money in payment for their services. On one occasion
my assistant was in camp at Kodaik&#257;nal on the Palni hills, the
higher altitudes of which are uninhabited by crows, and he had perforce
to march down to the plains, in order to perform the annual ceremony
for his deceased father. The recurring annual sr&#257;dh
(Praty&#257;bdhika) need not of necessity be performed. It is, however,
regarded as an important ceremony, and, should an individual neglect
it, he would run the risk of being excommunicated.</p>
<p>The rites connected with the dead are based on the Garuda
Pur&#257;na, according to which the libations of the ten days are said
to help the growth of the body of the soul. In this connection, Monier
Williams writes as follows:&mdash;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12468src"
href="#xd21e12468" name="xd21e12468src">93</a>&ldquo;On the first day,
the ball (pinda) of rice offered by the eldest son or other near
relative nourishes the spirit of the deceased in such a way as to
furnish it with a head; on the second day, the offered pinda gives a
neck and shoulders; on the third day a heart; on the fourth a back; on
the fifth a navel; on the sixth a groin <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb306" href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>and the parts usually
concealed; on the seventh thighs; on the eighth and ninth knees and
feet. On the tenth day, the intermediate body is sufficiently formed to
produce the sensation of hunger and thirst. Other pindas are therefore
put before it, and, on the eleventh and twelfth days, the embodied
spirit feeds voraciously on the offerings thus supplied, and so gains
strength for its journey to its future abode. Then, on the thirteenth
day after death, it is conducted either to heaven or hell. If to the
latter, it has need of the most nourishing food, to enable it to bear
up against the terrible ordeal which awaits it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the Hindu mind, Yama (the god of death) is a hideous god, whose
servants are represented as being capable of tormenting the soul of the
dead. &ldquo;No sooner,&rdquo; writes Monier Williams, &ldquo;has death
occurred, and cremation of the terrestrial body taken place, than
Yama&rsquo;s two messengers (Yama D&#363;tan), who are waiting near at
hand, make themselves visible to the released spirit, which retains its
subtle body composed of the subtle elements, and is said to be of the
size of a thumb (angustha-m&#257;tra). Their aspect is terrific, for
they have glaring eyes, hair standing erect, gnashing teeth, crow-black
skin, and claw-like nails, and they hold in their hands the awful rod
and noose of Yama. Then, as if their appearance in this form were not
sufficiently alarming, they proceed to terrify their victim by terrible
visions of the torments (y&#257;tana) in store for him. They then
convey the bound spirit along the road to Yama&rsquo;s abode. Being led
before Yama&rsquo;s judgment seat, it is confronted with his Registrar
or Recorder named Chitra Gupta. This officer stands by Yama&rsquo;s
side, with an open book before him. It is his business to note down all
the good and evil deeds of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href=
"#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>every human being born into the
world, with the resulting merit (punya) and demerit (p&#257;pa), and to
produce a debtor and creditor account properly made up and balanced on
the day when that being is brought before Yama. According to the
balance on the side of merit or demerit is judgment pronounced. The
road by which Yama&rsquo;s two officers force a wicked man to descend
to the regions of torment is described in the first two chapters of the
Garuda Pur&#257;na. The length of the way is said to be 86,000 leagues
(yojanas). The condemned soul, invested with its sensitive body, and
made to travel at the rate of 200 leagues a day, finds no shady trees,
no resting place, no food, no water. At one time it is scorched by a
burning heat equal to that of twelve meridian suns, at another it is
pierced by icy cold winds; now its tender frame is rent by thorns; now
it is attacked by lions, tigers, savage dogs, venomous serpents, and
scorpions. In one place it has to traverse a dense forest, whose leaves
are swords; in another it falls into deep pits; in another it is
precipitated from precipices; in another it has to walk on the edge of
razors; in another on iron spikes. Here it stumbles about helplessly in
profound darkness; there it struggles through loathsome mud swarming
with leeches; here it toils through burning sand; there its progress is
arrested by heaps of red-hot charcoal and stifling smoke. Compelled to
pass through every obstacle, however formidable, it next encounters a
succession of terrific showers, not of rain, but of live coals, stones,
blood, boiling water and filth. Then it has to descend into appalling
fissures, or ascend to sickening heights, or lose itself in vast caves,
or wade through lakes seething with f&oelig;tid ordures. Then midway it
has to pass the awful river Vaitarani, one hundred leagues in breadth,
of unfathomable depth; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href=
"#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>flowing with irresistible
impetuosity; filled with blood, matter, hair, and bones; infested with
huge sharks, crocodiles, and sea monsters; darkened by clouds of
hideous vultures and obscene birds of prey. Thousands of condemned
spirits stand trembling on the banks, horrified by the prospect before
them. Consumed by a raging thirst, they drink the blood which flows at
their feet; then, tumbling headlong into the torrent, they are
overwhelmed by the rushing waves. Finally, they are hurried down to the
lowest depths of hell, and yet not destroyed. Pursued by Yama&rsquo;s
officers, they are dragged away, and made to undergo inconceivable
tortures, the detail of which is given with the utmost minuteness in
the succeeding chapters of the Garuda Pur&#257;na.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ahannikams, or daily observances, of a religious Br&#257;hman
are very many. Nowadays, Br&#257;hmans who lead a purely religious life
are comparatively few, and are mostly found in villages. The daily
observances of such are the bath, the performance of the Sandhya
service, Brahma yagna, D&#275;va p&#363;ja or D&#275;vatarchana,
Tarpana (oblations of water), Vaisvad&#275;va ceremony, and the reading
of Pur&#257;nas or Ithih&#257;sas. Every orthodox Br&#257;hman is
expected to rise at the time called Brahma Muh&#363;rtam in the hour
and a half before sunrise. He should then clean his teeth, using as a
brush mango leaf, or twigs of <i lang="la-x-bio">Acacia arabica</i> or
n&#299;m (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>). He next bathes in
a river or tank (pond), standing knee-deep in the water, and repeating
the following:&mdash;&ldquo;I am about to perform the morning ablution
in this sacred stream (Ganges, Sarasvati, Yamuna, God&#257;vari, etc.),
in the presence of the gods and Br&#257;hmans, with a view to the
removal of guilt resulting from act, speech, and thought, from what has
been touched and untouched, known and unknown, eaten and not eaten,
drunk and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>not drunk.&rdquo; After the bath, he wipes his
body with a damp cloth, and puts on his cotton madi cloth, which has
been washed and dried. The cloth, washed, wrung, and hung up to dry,
should not be touched by anybody. If this should happen prior to the
bath, the cloth is polluted, and ceases to be madi. A silk cloth, which
cannot be polluted, is substituted for it. The madi or silk cloth
should be worn until the close of the morning ceremonies and meal. The
man next puts the marks which are characteristic of his sect on the
forehead and body, and performs the Sandhya service. This is very
important, and is binding on all Br&#257;hmans after the Upanayanam
ceremony, though a large number are not particular in observing it.
According to the sh&#257;stras, the Sandhya should be done in the
morning and evening; but in practice there is an additional service at
midday. Sandhy&#257;vandhanam means the thanksgiving to God when day
and night meet in the morning and evening. The rite commences with the
sipping of water (&#257;chamanam) from the hollow of the right palm.
This is done three times, while the words Achyuth&#257;yanamaha,
Anant&#257;yanamaha, and Govind&#257;yana are repeated. Immediately
after sipping, twelve parts of the body are touched with the fingers of
the right hand in the following order:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The two cheeks with the thumb, repeating the names
K&#275;sava and Nar&#257;yana;</p>
<p>The two eyes with the ring-finger, repeating M&#257;dhava and
Govinda;</p>
<p>The two sides of the nose with the forefinger, repeating Vishnu and
Madhus&#363;dhana;</p>
<p>The two ears with the little finger, repeating Trivkrama and
V&#257;mana;</p>
<p>The shoulders with the middle finger, repeating Sridhara and
Rishik&#275;sa; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310"
name="pb310">310</a>]</span></p>
<p>The navel and head with all the fingers, repeating Padmanabha and
Dam&#333;dar.</p>
</div>
<p>This &#256;chamana is the usual preliminary to all Br&#257;hman
religious rites. The water sipped is believed to cleanse the internal
parts of the body, as bathing cleanses the external parts.</p>
<p>After &#256;chamana comes Pr&#257;n&#257;y&#257;ma, or holding in of
vital breath, which consists in repeating the G&#257;yatri (hymn) and
holding the breath by three distinct operations, viz:&mdash;</p>
<p>P&#363;raka, or pressing the right nostril with the fingers, and
drawing in the breath through the left nostril, and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>.</p>
<p>Kumbhaka, or pressing both nostrils with finger and thumb or with
all the fingers, and holding the breath as long as possible.</p>
<p>R&#275;chaka, or pressing the right nostril with the thumb, and
expelling the breath through the left nostril, and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>.</p>
<p>The suppression of the breath is said to be a preliminary y&#333;ga
practice, enabling a person to fix his mind on the Supreme Being who is
meditated on.</p>
<p>The celebrant next repeats the Sankalpa (determination), with the
hands brought together, the right palm over the left, and placed on the
right thigh. Every kind of ceremony commences with the Sankalpa, which,
for the Sandhya service, is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I am worshipping
for the removal of all my sins that have adhered to me, and for the
purpose of acquiring the favour of Nar&#257;yana or the Supreme
Being.&rdquo; The performer of the rite then sprinkles himself with
water, repeating:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! ye waters, the sources of all
comforts, grant us food, so that our senses may grow strong and give us
joy. Make us the recipients of your essence, which is the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>most
blissful, just as affectionate mothers (feed their children with milk
from their breasts). May we obtain enough of that essence of yours, the
existence of which within you makes you feel glad. Oh! waters, grant us
offspring.&rdquo; He then takes up the water in his palm, and drinks
it, repeating the following:&mdash;&ldquo;May the sun and anger, may
the lords of anger, preserve me from my sins of pride and passion.
Whate&rsquo;er the nightly sins of thought, word, deed, wrought by my
mind, my speech, my hands, my feet; wrought through my appetite and
sensual organs; may the departing night remove them all. In thy
immortal light, Oh! radiant sun, I offer up myself and this my
guilt.&rdquo; At the evening service, the same is repeated, with the
word Agni instead of S&#363;rya (sun). At the midday service the
following is recited:&mdash;&ldquo;May the waters purify the earth by
pouring down rain. May the earth thus purified make us pure. May the
waters purify my spiritual preceptor, and may the V&#275;da (as taught
by the purified preceptor) purify me. Whatever leavings of
another&rsquo;s food, and whatever impure things I may have eaten,
whatever I may have received as gift from the unworthy, may the waters
destroy all that sin and purify me. For this purpose, I pour this
sanctified water as a libation down my mouth.&rdquo; Once more the
celebrant sprinkles himself with water, and says:&mdash;&ldquo;I sing
the praise of the god Dadikr&#257;van, who is victorious,
all-pervading, and who moves with great speed. May he make our mouths
(and the senses) fragrant, and may he prolong our lives. Oh! ye waters,
the sources of all comforts, grant us food,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>The ceremonies performed so far are intended for both external and
internal purification. By their means, the individual is supposed to
have made himself worthy to salute the Lord who resides in the orb of
the rising <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>luminary, and render him homage in true
Br&#257;hman style by what is called Arghya. This is an offering of
water to any respected guest. Repeating the G&#257;yatri, the
worshipper throws water in the air from the palms of the hands joined
together with the sacred thread round the thumbs. The G&#257;yatri is
the hymn <i>par excellence</i>, and is said to contain the sum and
substance of all V&#275;dic teaching.</p>
<p>After these items, the worshipper sits down, and does Japam
(recitation of prayers in an undertone). The G&#257;yatri, as repeated,
consists of the G&#257;yatri proper Vy&#257;hritis, and G&#257;yatri
Siromantra. It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&#332;m, Bhuh; &#332;m, Bhuvah;</p>
<p class="line">&#332;m, Suvah; &#332;m, Mahaha;</p>
<p class="line">&#332;m, Janaha; &#332;m, Thapaha;</p>
<p class="line">&#332;m, Sathyam.</p>
<p class="line">&#332;m, Thatsaviturv&#257;r&#275;nyam;</p>
<p class="line">Bhargod&#275;vasya dhimahi dhiyo-yonah
prachod&#257;yat;</p>
<p class="line">&#332;m, Jyotiraso amrutam</p>
<p class="line">Brahma, Bhur, Bhuvasvar&#363;m.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The Vy&#257;hritis are generally taken to refer to the
seven worlds, and the prefixing of the Pranava (&#332;m) means that all
these worlds have sprung from the Supreme Being. The Pranava given
above means &ldquo;All the seven worlds are (the visible manifestations
of) &#332;m, the all-pervading Br&#257;hman. We think of the adorable
light of the Lord, who shines in our hearts, and guides us. May he
guide our intellects aright. Water, light, all things that have savour
(such as trees, herbs, and plants), the nectar of the gods, the three
worlds, in fact everything that is Br&#257;hman, the universal
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mystic syllable &#332;m is the most sacred of all Hindu
utterances. Concerning it, Monier Williams writes that it is
&ldquo;made up of the three letters A, U, M, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>and
symbolical of the threefold manifestation of the one Supreme Being in
the gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, and is constantly repeated during
the Sandhya service. This prayer is, as we have seen, the most sacred
of all V&#275;dic utterances, and, like the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer among
Christians, or like the Fatihah or opening chapter of the Kuran among
Muhammadans, must always, among Hindus, take precedence of all other
forms of supplication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The celebrant next proceeds to invoke the G&#257;yatri D&#275;vata
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;May the goddess G&#257;yatri D&#275;vata, who grants
all our desires, come to us to make known to us the eternal Lord, who
is revealed to us only through the scriptures. May the G&#257;yatri,
the mother of all the V&#275;das, reveal to us the eternal truth. Oh!
G&#257;yatri, thou art the source of all spiritual strength. Thou art
the power that drivest away the evil inclinations which are mine
enemies. Thou, by conducing to a sound mind, conducest to a sound body.
Thou art the light of the gods, that dispellest my intellectual
darkness, and illuminest my heart with divine wisdom. Thou art all. In
the whole universe there is naught but thee that is. Thou art the
eternal truth that destroys all sins. Thou art the Pranava that reveals
to me the unknown. Come to my succour, Oh! thou G&#257;yatri, and make
me wise.&rdquo; This invocation is followed by the repetition of the
G&#257;yatri 108 or only 28 times. The celebrant then
says:&mdash;&ldquo;The goddess G&#257;yatri resides on a lofty peak on
the summit of mount M&#275;ru (whose base is deeply fixed) in the
earth. Oh! thou goddess, take leave from the Br&#257;hmans (who have
worshipped thee, and been blessed with thy grace), and go back to thy
abode as comfortably as possible.&rdquo; The Sandhya service is closed
with the following prayer to the rising sun:&mdash;&ldquo;We sing the
adorable glory of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314"
name="pb314">314</a>]</span>the sun god, who sustains all men (by
causing rain); which glory is eternal, and most worthy of being adored
with wonder. The sun, well knowing the inclinations of men, directs
them to their several pursuits. The sun upholds both heaven and earth;
the sun observes all creatures (and their actions) without ever
winking. To this eternal being we offer the oblation mixed with
gh&#299;. Oh! sun, may that man who through such sacrifice offers
oblations to thee become endowed with wealth and plenty. He who is
under thy protection is not cut off by untimely death; he is not
vanquished by anybody, and sin has no hold on this man either from near
or from afar.&rdquo; In the evening, the following prayer to Varuna is
substituted:&mdash;&ldquo;Hear, Oh! Varuna, this prayer of mine. Be
gracious unto me this day. Longing for thy protection, I cry to thee.
Adoring thee with prayer, I beg long life of thee. The sacrificer does
the same with the oblations he offers thee. Therefore, Oh! Varuna,
without indifference in this matter, take my prayer into your kind
consideration, and do not cut off our life. Oh! Lord Varuna, whatever
law of thine we, as men, violate day after day, forgive us these
trespasses. Oh! Lord Varuna, whatever offence we, as men, have
committed against divine beings, whatever work of thine we have
neglected through ignorance, do not destroy us, Oh! Lord, for such sin.
Whatever sin is attributed to us by our enemies, as by gamblers at
dice, whatever sins we may have really committed, and what we may have
done without knowing, do thou scatter and destroy all these sins. Then,
Oh! Lord, we shall become beloved of thee.&rdquo; The Sandhya prayer
closes with the Abhiv&#257;dhana or salutation, which has been given in
the account of marriage. After the Sandhya service in the morning, the
Brahma yagna, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315"
name="pb315">315</a>]</span>worship of the Supreme Being as represented
in the sacred books is gone through. The first hymn of the Rig
V&#275;da is recited in detail, and then follow the first words of the
Yajur V&#275;da, S&#257;ma V&#275;da, Atharvana V&#275;da, the Nirukta,
etc.</p>
<p>The next item is the Tarpana ceremony, or offering of water to the
D&#275;vatas, Rishis, and Pitris. The sacred thread is placed over the
left shoulder and under the right arm (upav&#299;ta), and water is
taken in the right hand, and poured as an offering to the D&#275;vatas.
Then, with the sacred thread round the neck like a necklace (niviti),
the worshipper pours water for the Rishis. Lastly, the sacred thread is
placed over the right shoulder (pr&#257;chin&#257; v&#299;thi) and
water is poured for the Pitris (ancestors).</p>
<p>The various ceremonies described so far should be performed by all
the male members of a family, whereas the daily D&#275;vatarchana or
D&#275;vata p&#363;ja is generally done by any one member of a family.
The gods worshipped by pious Br&#257;hmans are Siva and Vishnu, and
their consorts Parvati and Lakshmi. Homage is paid thereto through
images, s&#257;lagr&#257;ma stones, or stone lingams. In the house of a
Br&#257;hman, a corner or special room is set apart for the worship of
the god. Some families keep their gods in a small almirah (chest).</p>
<p>Smarthas use in their domestic worship five stones, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> S&#257;lagr&#257;ma, representing Vishnu.</li>
<li><span>2.</span> B&#257;na linga, a white stone representing the
essence of Siva.</li>
<li><span>3.</span> A red stone (jasper), representing
Gan&#275;sha.</li>
<li><span>4.</span> A bit of metallic ore, representing Parvathi, or a
lingam representing Siva and Parvathi.</li>
<li><span>5.</span> A piece of pebble or crystal, to represent the
sun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Smarthas commence their worship by invoking the aid of
Vign&#275;swara (Gan&#275;sha). Then, placing a vessel <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>(kalasa) filled with water, they utter the
following prayer. &ldquo;In the mouth of the water-vessel abideth
Vishnu, in its lower part is Brahma, while the whole company of the
mothers (m&#257;tris) are congregated in its middle part. Oh! Ganges,
Yamun&#257;, God&#257;vari, Sarasvati, Narmad&#257;, Sindhu, and
K&#257;veri, be present in this water.&rdquo; The conch or chank shell
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Turbinella rapa</i>) is then worshipped as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! conch shell, thou wast produced in the sea,
and art held by Vishnu in his hand. Thou art worshipped by all the
gods. Receive my homage.&rdquo; The bell is then worshipped with the
prayer:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! bell, make a sound for the approach of the
gods, and for the departure of the demons. Homage to the goddess
Ghant&#257; (bell). I offer perfumes, grains of rice, and flowers, in
token of rendering all due homage to the bell.&rdquo; The worshipper
claps his hands, and rings the bell. All the tulsi (sacred basil,
<i lang="la-x-bio">Ocimum sanctum</i>) leaves, flowers, sandal paste,
etc., used for worship on the previous day, are removed. &ldquo;The
tulsi is the most sacred plant in the Hindu religion; it is
consequently found in or near almost every Hindu house throughout
India. Hindu poets say that it protects from misfortune, and sanctifies
and guides to heaven all who cultivate it. The Brahmins hold it sacred
to the gods Krishna and Vishnu. The story goes that this plant is the
transformed nymph Tulasi, beloved of Krishna, and for this reason near
every Hindu house it is cultivated in pots, or in brick or earthen
pillars with hollows at the top (brind&#257;vanam or brinda forest), in
which earth is deposited. It is daily watered, and worshipped by all
the members of the family. Under favourable circumstances, it grows to
a considerable size, and furnishes a woody stem large enough to make
beads for the rosaries used by Hindus, on which they count the number
of recitations <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=
"pb317">317</a>]</span>of their deity&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e12607src" href="#xd21e12607" name=
"xd21e12607src">94</a> Writing in the seventeenth century, Vincenzo
Maria<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12611src" href="#xd21e12611" name=
"xd21e12611src">95</a> observes that &ldquo;almost all the Hindus ...
adore a plant like our Basilico gentile, but of a more pungent
odour.... Every one before his house has a little altar, girt with a
wall half an ell high, in the middle of which they erect certain
pedestals like little towers, and in these the shrub is grown. They
recite their prayers daily before it, with repeated prostrations,
sprinklings of water, etc. There are also many of these maintained at
the bathing-places, and in the courts of the pagodas.&rdquo; The
legend, accounting for the sanctity of the tulsi, is told in the Padma
Pur&#257;na.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12614src" href="#xd21e12614"
name="xd21e12614src">96</a> From the union of the lightning that
flashed from the third eye of Siva with the ocean, a boy was born, whom
Brahmad&#275;v caught up, and to whom he gave the name of Jalandhar.
And to him Brahmad&#275;v gave the boon that by no hand but
Siva&rsquo;s could he perish. Jalandhar grew up strong and tall, and
conquered the kings of the earth, and, in due time, married Vrinda (or
Brinda), the daughter of the demon Kalnemi. Naradmuni, the son of
Brahmad&#275;v, stirred up hatred against Siva in Jalandhar, and they
fought each other on the slopes of Kail&#257;s. But even Siva could not
prevail against Jalandhar, so long as his wife Vrinda remained chaste.
So Vishnu, who had lived with her and Jalandhar, and had learnt their
secret, plotted her downfall. One day, when she, sad at
Jalandhar&rsquo;s absence, had left her garden to walk in the waste
beyond, two demons met her and pursued her. She ran, with the demons
following, until she saw a Rishi, at whose feet she fell, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>and
asked for shelter. The Rishi, with his magic, burnt up the demons into
thin ash. Vrinda then asked for news of her husband. At once, two apes
laid before her Jalandhar&rsquo;s head, feet, and hands. Vrinda,
thinking that he was dead, begged the Rishi to restore him to her. The
Rishi said that he would try, and in a moment he and the corpse had
disappeared, and Jalandhar stood by her. She threw herself into his
arms, and they embraced each other. But, some days later, she learnt
that he with whom she was living was not her husband, but Vishnu, who
had taken his shape. She cursed Vishnu, and foretold that, in a later
Avatar, the two demons who had frightened her would rob him of his
wife; and that, to recover her, he would have to ask the aid of the
apes who had brought Jalandhar&rsquo;s head, feet, and hands. Vrinda
then threw herself into a burning pit, and Jalandhar, once
Vrinda&rsquo;s chastity had gone, fell a prey to Siva&rsquo;s
thunderbolts. Then the gods came forth from their hiding place, and
garlanded Siva. The demons were driven back to hell, and men once more
passed under the tyranny of the gods. But Vishnu came not back from
Vrinda&rsquo;s palace, and those who sought him found him mad from
grief, rolling in her ashes. Then Parvati, to break the charm of
Vrinda&rsquo;s beauty, planted in her ashes three seeds. And they grew
into three plants, the tulsi, the avali, and the malti. By the growth
of these seeds, Vishnu was released from Vrinda&rsquo;s charm.
Therefore he loved them all, but chiefly the tulsi plant, which, as he
said, was Vrinda&rsquo;s very self. In the seventh incarnation, the two
demons, who had frightened <span class="corr" id="xd21e12621" title=
"Source: Vrindan">Vrinda</span>, became Ravan and his brother
Kumbhakarna, and they bore away S&#299;ta to Lanka. To recover her,
Ramchandra had to implore the help of the two apes who had brought her
Jalandhar&rsquo;s head and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href=
"#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>hands, and in this incarnation
they became Hanuman and his warriors. But, in the eighth incarnation,
which was that of Krishna, the tulsi plant took the form of a woman
R&#257;dha, and wedded the gay and warlike lord of Dwarka.</p>

<p>While the five stones already referred to are bathed by pouring
water from a conch shell, the Purusha S&#363;ktha, or hymn of the Rig
V&#275;da, is repeated. This runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Purusha has
thousands of heads, thousands of arms, thousands of eyes, and thousands
of feet. On every side enveloping the earth, he transcended this mere
space of ten fingers. Purusha himself is this whole (universe);
whatever has been, and whatever shall be. He is also the lord of
immortality, since through food he expands. Such is his greatness, and
Purusha is superior to this. All existing things are a quarter of him,
and that which is immortal in the sky is three quarters of him. With
three quarters Purusha mounted upwards. A quarter of him was again
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=
"pb320">320</a>]</span>produced below. He then became diffused
everywhere among things, animate and inanimate. From him Viraj was
born, and from Viraj Purusha. As soon as born, he extended beyond the
earth, both behind and before. When the gods offered up Purusha as a
sacrifice, the spring was its clarified butter (gh&#299;), summer its
fuel, and the autumn the oblation. This victim, Purusha born in the
beginning, they consecrated on the sacrificial grass. With him as their
offering, the Gods, Sadhyas, and Rishis sacrificed. From that universal
oblations were produced curds and clarified butter. He, Purusha, formed
the animals which are subject to the power of the air (V&#257;yavya),
both wild and tame. From that universal sacrifice sprang the hymns
called Rik and Saman, the Metres, and the Yajus. From it were produced
horses, and all animals with two rows of teeth, cows, goats, and sheep.
When they divided Purusha, into how many parts did they distribute him?
What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were called his thighs and
feet? The Br&#257;hman was his mouth; the R&#257;janya became his arms;
the Vaisya was his thighs; the S&#363;dra sprang from his feet. The
moon was produced from his soul; the sun from his eye; Indra and Agni
from his mouth; V&#257;yu from his breath. From his navel came the
atmosphere; from his head arose the sky; from his feet came the earth;
from his ears the four quarters; so they formed the worlds. When the
gods, in performing their sacrifice, bound Purusha as a victim, there
were seven pieces of wood laid for him round the fire, and thrice seven
pieces of fuel employed. With sacrifice the gods worshipped the
sacrifice. These were the prim&aelig;val rites. These great beings
attained to the heaven, where the Gods, the ancient S&#257;dhyas,
reside.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=

<p>Some Smarthas, <i>e.g.</i>, the Brahacharnams, are more Saivite than
other sections of Tamil-speaking Br&#257;hmans. During worship, they
wear round the neck rudr&#257;ksha (<i>El&aelig;ocarpus Ganitrus</i>)
beads, and place on their head a lingam made thereof. In connection
with the rudr&#257;ksha, the legend runs that Siva or K&#257;l&#257;gni
Rudra, while engaged in Tripura Samh&#257;ra, opened his third eye,
which led to the destruction of the three cities, of which
R&#257;kshasas or Asuras had taken the form. From this eye liquid is
said to have trickled on the ground, and from this arose the
rudr&#257;ksha tree. The mere mention of the word rudr&#257;ksha is
believed to secure religious merit, which may be said to be equivalent
to the merit obtained by the gift of ten cows to Br&#257;hmans.
Rudr&#257;ksha beads are valued according to the number of lobes (or
faces, as they are called), which are ordinarily five in number. A bead
with six lobes is said to be very good, and one with two lobes, called
Gauri Sankara rudr&#257;ksha, is specially valued. D&#299;kshitar
Br&#257;hmans, and Pand&#257;ram priests of the higher order, wear a
two-lobed bead mounted in gold. In a manuscript entitled
Rudr&#257;kshopanishad, it is stated that a good rudr&#257;ksha bead,
when rubbed with water, should colour the water yellow. The
M&#257;dhvas worship in the same way as Smarthas, but the objects of
worship are the s&#257;lagr&#257;ma stone, and images of Hanum&#257;n
and &#256;di S&#275;sha. Food offered to &#256;di S&#275;sha, Lakshmi,
and Hanum&#257;n, is not eaten, but thrown away. The M&#257;dhvas
attach great importance to their spiritual guru, who is first
worshipped by a worshipper. Some keep a brind&#257;vanam, representing
the grave of their guru, along with a s&#257;lagr&#257;ma stone, which
is worshipped at the close of the D&#275;vata p&#363;ja. Sri Vaishnavas
keep for domestic worship only s&#257;lagr&#257;ma stones. Like the
M&#257;dhvas, they are scrupulous as to the worship of their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>gurus (&#257;charyas), without whose
intervention they believe that they cannot obtain beatitude. Hence Sri
Vaishnavites insist upon the Sam&#257;srayanam ceremony. After the
Sandhya service and Brahma yagna, the guru is worshipped. All orthodox
Vaishnavas keep with them a silk cloth bearing the impressions of the
feet of their &#256;charya, an abhayastha or impression of the hand of
Vishnu in sandal paste, a few necklaces of silk thread (pavitram), and
a bit of the bark of the tamarind tree growing at the temple at
&#256;lvartirunagiri in the Tinnevelly district. The worshipper puts on
his head the silk cloth, and round his neck the silk necklaces, and, if
available, a necklace of <i>Nelumbium</i> (sacred lotus) seeds. After
saluting the abhayastha by pressing it to his eyes, he repeats the
prayer of his &#256;charya, and proceeds to the D&#275;vatarchana,
which consists in the performance of the sixteen upach&#257;ras already
described. The s&#257;lagr&#257;ma stone is bathed, and the Purusha
S&#363;ktha repeated.</p>
<p>The daily observances are brought to a close by the performance of
the Vaisvad&#275;va ceremony, or offering to Vaisvad&#275;vas (all the
gods). This consists in offering cooked rice, etc., to all the gods.
Some regard this as a sort of expiatory ceremony, to wipe out the sin
which may have accidentally been committed by killing small animals in
the process of cooking food.</p>

<p>The male members of a family take their meals apart from the
females. The food is served on platters made of the leaves of the
banyan (<i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus bengalensis</i>), <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Butea frondosa</i>, <i lang="la-x-bio">Bauhinia</i>, or
plantain. Amongst Smarthas and M&#257;dhvas, various vegetable
preparations are served first, and rice last, whereas, amongst the Sri
Vaishnavas, especially Vadagalais, rice is served first. Before
commencing to eat, a little water (t&#299;rtham), in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>which a s&#257;lagr&#257;ma stone has been
bathed, is poured into the palms of those who are about to partake of
the meal. They drink the water simultaneously, saying
&ldquo;Amartopastaranamasi.&rdquo; They then put a few handfuls of rice
into their mouths, repeating some
mantras&mdash;&ldquo;Pran&#257;yasv&#257;ha, Udanayasv&#257;ha,
Somanayasv&#257;ha,&rdquo; etc. At the end of the meal, all are served
with a little water, which they sip, saying
&ldquo;Amartapith&#257;namasi.&rdquo; They then rise together.</p>
<p>In connection with the s&#257;lagr&#257;ma stone, which has been
referred to several times, the following interesting account
thereof<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12737src" href="#xd21e12737" name=
"xd21e12737src">97</a> may be quoted:&mdash;&ldquo;S&#257;lagr&#257;ms
are fossil cephalopods (ammonites), and are found chiefly in the bed of
the Gandak river, a mountain torrent which, rising in the lofty
mountains of Nepal, flows into the Ganges at S&#257;lagr&#257;mi, a
village from which they take their name, and which is not far from the
sacred city of Benares. In appearance they are small black shiny
pebbles of various shapes, usually round or oval, with a peculiar
natural hole in them. They have certain marks to be described later,
and are often flecked and inlaid with gold [or pyrites]. The name
s&#257;lagr&#257;m is of Sanskrit derivation, from sara chakra, the
weapon of Vishnu, and grava, a stone; the chakra or chakram being
represented on the stone by queer spiral lines, popularly believed to
be engraved thereon at the request of Vishnu by the creator Brahma,
who, in the form of a worm, bores the holes known as vadanas, and
traces the spiral coil that gives the stone its name. There is a
curious legend connected with their origin. In ancient times there
lived a certain dancing-girl, the most beautiful that had ever been
created, so beautiful indeed that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324"
href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>it was impossible to find a
suitable consort for her. The girl, in despair at her loveliness, hid
herself in the mountains, in the far away Himalayas, and there spent
several years in prayer, till at last Vishnu appeared before her, and
asked what she wanted. She begged him to tell her how it was that the
great creator Brahma, who had made her so beautiful, had not created a
male consort for her of similar perfect form. Then she looked on
Vishnu, and asked the god to kiss her. Vishnu could not comply with her
request as she was a dancing-girl, and of low caste, but promised by
his virtue that she should be reincarnated in the Himalayas in the form
of a river, which should bear the name Gandaki, and that he would be in
the river as her eternal consort in the shape of a s&#257;lagr&#257;m.
Thereupon the river Gandaki rose from the Himalayas, and
s&#257;lagr&#257;ms were found in it. How the true virtue of the
s&#257;lagr&#257;m was discovered is another strange little fable. A
poor boy of the Kshatriya or warrior class once found one when playing
by the river side. He soon discovered that when he had it in his hand,
or secreted in his mouth, or about his person, his luck was so
extraordinary at marbles or whatever game he played, that he always
won. At last he so excelled in all he undertook that he rose to be a
great king. Finally Vishnu himself came to fetch him, and bore him away
in a cloud. The mystic river Gandaki is within the jurisdiction of the
Mah&#257;r&#257;ja of Nepal, and is zealously guarded on both banks,
while the four special places where the sacred stones are mostly picked
up are leased out under certain conditions, the most important being
that all true s&#257;lagr&#257;ms found are to be submitted to the
Mah&#257;r&#257;ja. These are then tested, the selected ones retained,
and the others returned to the lessee. The first test of the
s&#257;lagr&#257;ms to prove <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href=
"#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>if they are genuine is very
simple, but later they are put through other ordeals to try their
supernatural powers. Each stone, as it is discovered, is struck on all
sides with a small hammer, or, in some cases, is merely knocked with
the finger. This causes the soft powdery part, produced by the boring
of the worm, to fall in and disclose the vadana or hole, which may, in
the more valuable s&#257;lagr&#257;ms, contain gold or a precious gem.
In addition to the real stone with chakram and vadana formed by natural
causes, there are found in many mountain streams round black pebbles
resembling the true s&#257;lagr&#257;m in colour, shape, and size, but
lacking the chakram and vadana. These are collected by Bair&#257;gis,
or holy mendicants, who bore imitation vadanas in them, and, tracing
false chakrams in balapa or slate stone, paste them on the pebbles. So
skilfully is this fraud perpetrated that it is only after years of use
and perpetual washing at the daily p&#363;ja that in time the tracery
wears away, and detection becomes possible. There are over eighteen
known and different kinds of true s&#257;lagr&#257;ms, the initial
value of which varies according to the shape and markings of the stone.
The price of any one s&#257;lagr&#257;m may be so enhanced after the
further tests have been applied, that even a lakh of rupees (Rs.
1,00,000) will fail to purchase it; and, should experience prove the
stone a lucky one, nothing will, as a rule, induce the fortunate owner
to part with it. The three shapes of s&#257;lagr&#257;ms most highly
prized are known as the Vishnu s&#257;lagr&#257;m, the Lakshmi
Narasimha s&#257;lagr&#257;m, and the Mutchya Murti s&#257;lagr&#257;m.
The first has a chakram on it the shape of a garland, and bears marks
known as the shenka (conch) gada padma, or the weapons of Vishnu, and
is peculiar to that god. The second has two chakrams on the left of the
vadana, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>has dots or specks all over it. This stone, if
properly worshipped, is believed to ensure to its owner prosperity and
eternal life. The third, the Mutchya Murti, is a long-shaped flat stone
with a vadana that gives it a resemblance to the face of a fish. It
bears two chakrams, one inside and one outside the vadana, and also has
specks and dots on it in the shape of a shoe. There are four or five
varieties of this species, and it also, if duly worshipped, will
infallibly enrich its possessor. One s&#257;lagr&#257;m there is which
has no vadana, and is known as the ugra chakra s&#257;lagr&#257;m. It
is quite round with two chakrams, but it is not a particularly safe one
to possess, and is described as a &lsquo;furious
s&#257;lagr&#257;ma,&rsquo; for, if not worshipped with sufficient
ardour, it will resent the neglect, and ruin the owner. The first thing
to do on obtaining a s&#257;lagr&#257;m is to find out whether or not
it is a lucky stone, for a stone that will bring luck to one owner may
mean ruin for another. The tests are various; a favourite one is to
place the s&#257;lagr&#257;m with its exact weight of rice together in
one place for the night. If the rice has increased in the morning (and,
in some cases, my informant assures me, it will be found to have
doubled in quantity), then the stone is one to be regarded by its lucky
holder as priceless, and on no account to be parted with. If, on the
other hand, the rice measures the same, or&mdash;dreadful
omen&mdash;has even become less, then let the house be rid of it as
early as possible. If no purchaser can be found, make a virtue of
necessity, and send it as a present to the nearest temple or mutt
(religious institution), where the Gurus know how to appease the wrath
of the Deity with daily offerings of fruits and flowers. A
s&#257;lagr&#257;m will never bring any luck if its possession is
acquired by fraud or force. The story runs that once a Br&#257;hman,
finding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>one with a Mahomedan butcher, obtained it by
theft. The luckless man speedily rued the day of his time, for, from
that time onwards, nothing prospered, and he ended his days a destitute
pauper. Again, possession of them without worship is believed by all
Hindus to be most unlucky, and, as none but Br&#257;hmans can perform
the worship, none but Br&#257;hmans will retain the stones in their
keeping. For an orthodox Br&#257;hman household, the ownership of three
or more stones is an absolute necessity. These must be duly worshipped
and washed with water, and the water drunk as t&#299;rtha, and
sacrifice of boiled rice and other food must be daily performed. When
this is done, speedy success in all the business of life will fall to
the lot of the inmates of the house, but otherwise ruin and disgrace
await them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In some temples, the M&#363;la Vigraha, or idol fixed in the inner
sanctuary, is decorated with a necklace of s&#257;lagr&#257;ma stones.
For example, at Tirupati the god is thus decorated.</p>
<p>The following incident in connection with a s&#257;lagr&#257;ma
stone is narrated by Yule and Burnell<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e12752src" href="#xd21e12752" name=
"xd21e12752src">98</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;In May, 1883, a
s&#257;lagr&#257;ma was the ostensible cause of great popular
excitement among the Hindus of Calcutta. During the proceedings in a
family suit before the High Court, a question arose regarding the
identity of a s&#257;lagr&#257;ma, regarded as a household god. Counsel
on both sides suggested that the thing should be brought into court.
Mr. Justice Morris hesitated to give this order till he had taken
advice. The attorneys on both sides, Hindus, said there could be no
objection; the Court interpreter, a high-caste Br&#257;hman, said it
could not be brought into Court because of the coir matting,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>but it might with perfect propriety be brought
into the corridor for inspection; which was done. This took place
during the excitement about the &lsquo;Ilbert Bill,&rsquo; giving
natives magisterial authority in the provinces over Europeans; and
there followed most violent and offensive articles in several native
newspapers reviling Mr. Justice Morris, who was believed to be hostile
to the Bill. The Editor of the Bengallee newspaper, an educated man,
and formerly a member of the Covenanted Civil Service, the author of
one of the most unscrupulous and violent articles, was summoned for
contempt of court. He made an apology and complete <span class="corr"
id="xd21e12757" title="Source: retractation">retraction</span>, but was
sentenced to two months&rsquo; imprisonment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sacred chank, conch, or sankhu, which has been referred to in
connection with ceremonial observance, is the shell of the gastropod
mollusc <i lang="la-x-bio">Turbinella rapa</i>. This is secured, in
Southern India, by divers from Tuticorin in the vicinity of the pearl
banks. The chank shell, which one sees suspended on the forehead and
round the neck of bullocks, is not only used by Hindus for offering
libations, and as a musical instrument in temples, but is also cut into
armlets, bracelets, and other ornaments. Writing in the sixteenth
century, Garcia says:&mdash;&ldquo;This chanco is a ware for the Bengal
trade, and formerly produced more profit than now ... and there was
formerly a custom in Bengal that no virgin in honour and esteem could
be corrupted unless it were by placing bracelets of chanco on her arms;
but, since the Pat&#257;ns came in, this usage has more or less
ceased.&rdquo; &ldquo;The conch shell,&rdquo; Captain C. R. Day
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e12765src" href="#xd21e12765" name=
"xd21e12765src">99</a> &ldquo;is not in secular use as a musical
instrument, but is found in every temple, and is sounded during
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>religious ceremonials, in processions, and
before the shrines of Hindu deities. In Southern India, the sankhu is
employed in the ministration of a class of temple servers called
D&#257;sari. No tune, so to speak, can of course be played upon it, but
still the tone is capable of much modulation by the lips, and its clear
mellow notes are not without a certain charm. A rather striking effect
is produced when it is used in the temple ritual as a sort of
rhythmical accompaniment, when it plays the part of kannag&#333;lu or
t&#257;laviny&#257;sa.&rdquo; In a petition from two natives of the
city of Madras in 1734, in connection with the expenses for erecting a
town called Chintadrepettah, the following occurs<a class="noteref" id=
"n419.asrc" href="#n419.a" name=
"n419.asrc">100</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;Expended towards digging a
foundation, where chanks was buried with accustomary ceremonies.&rdquo;
A right-handed chank (<i>i.e.</i>, one which has its spiral opening to
the right), which was found off the coast of Ceylon at Jaffna in 1887,
was sold for Rs. 700. Such a chank is said to have been sometimes
priced at a lakh of rupees; and, writing in 1813, Milburn says<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n419.a">100</a> that a chank opening to the
right hand is greatly valued, and always sells for its weight in gold.
Further, Bald&aelig;us narrates the legend that Garroude flew in all
haste to Brahma, and brought to Kistna the chianko or kinkhorn twisted
to the right. The chank appears as a symbol on coins of the
Ch&#257;lukyan and P&#257;ndyan dynasties of Southern India, and on the
modern coins of the Mah&#257;r&#257;jas of Travancore.</p>
<p>Temple worship is entirely based on &#256;gamas. As Br&#257;hmans
take part only in the worship of Siva and Vishnu, temples dedicated to
these gods are largely frequented by them. The duties connected with
the actual worship of the idol are carried out by Gurukkals
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>in Siva temples, and by P&#257;ncharatra or
Vaikh&#257;nasa Archakas in Vishnu temples. The cooking of the food for
the daily offering is done by Br&#257;hmans called Parch&#257;rakas. At
the time of worship, some Br&#257;hmans, called Adhy&#257;pakas, recite
the V&#275;das. Some stanzas from Thiruv&#257;imozhi or
Th&#275;v&#257;ram are also repeated, the former by Br&#257;hmans at
Vishnu temples, and the latter by Pand&#257;rams (&#332;duvar) at Siva
temples. In a typical temple there are usually two idols, one of stone
(m&#363;la vigraha) and the other of metal (utsava vigraha). The
m&#363;la vigraha is permanently fixed within the inner shrine or
garbagraha, and the utsava vigraha is intended to be carried in
procession. The m&#363;la vigrahas of Vishnu temples are generally in
human form, either in a standing posture, or, as in the case of
Rangan&#257;tha, Padman&#257;bha, and Govindar&#257;jasw&#257;mi, in a
reclining posture, on &#256;dis&#275;sha. Ordinarily, three idols
constitute the m&#363;la vigraha. These are Vishnu, Srid&#275;vi
(Lakshmi), and Bhud&#275;vi (earth goddess). In temples dedicated to
Sri R&#257;ma, Lakshmana is found instead of Bhud&#275;vi. Srid&#275;vi
and Bhud&#275;vi are also associated with Vishnu in the utsava vigraha.
In all the larger temples, there is a separate building in the temple
precincts dedicated to Lakshmi, and within the garbagraha thereof,
called th&#257;yar or n&#257;chiyar sannadhi, is a m&#363;la vigraha of
Lakshmi. There may also be one or more shrines dedicated to the
&#256;lvars (Vaishnava saints) and the
&#256;ch&#257;ryas&mdash;D&#275;sikar and Manav&#257;la
Mah&#257;munigal. The sect mark is put on the faces of the m&#363;la
and utsava vigrahas. The m&#363;la vigraha in Siva temples is a lingam
(phallic emblem). In Siva temples, there is within the garbagraha only
one lamp burning, which emits a very feeble light. Hence arise the
common sayings &ldquo;As dim as the light burning in Siva&rsquo;s
temple,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Like the lamp <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb331" href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>in Siva&rsquo;s
temple.&rdquo; The utsava vigraha is in the human forms of Siva and
Parvathi. In all important Saivite temples, Parvathi is housed in a
separate building, as Lakshmi is in Vishnu temples. Vign&#275;swara,
Subramanya, and the important N&#257;yanmars also have separate shrines
in the temple precincts.</p>

<p>So far as ordinary daily worship is concerned, there is not much
difference in the mode of worship between temple and domestic worship.
Every item is done on a large scale, and certain special &#256;gamic or
Tantric rites are added to the sixteen Upach&#257;ras already
mentioned. At the present time, there are, especially in the case of
Vishnu temples, two forms of temple worship, called P&#257;ncharatra
and Vaikh&#257;nasa. In the former, which is like domestic worship in
all essential points, any Br&#257;hman may officiate as temple priest.
In the latter, only Vaikh&#257;nasa Archakas may officiate.</p>
<p>All big temples are generally well endowed, and some temples receive
from Government annual grants of money, called tasdik. The management
of the temple affairs rests with the Dharmakarthas (trustees), who
practically have absolute control over the temple funds. All the temple
servants, such as Archakas, Parch&#257;rakas, and Adhy&#257;pakas, and
the non-Br&#257;hman servants (sweepers, flower-gatherers, musicians
and dancing-girls) are subject to the authority of the Dharmakartha.
For their services in the temple, these people are paid partly in
money, and partly in kind. The cooked food, which is offered daily to
the god, is distributed among the temple servants. On ordinary days,
the offerings of cooked food made by the Archakas, and the fruits
brought by those who come to worship, are offered only to the m&#363;la
vigraha, whereas, on festival days, they are offered to the utsava
vigrahas. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span></p>
<p>For worship in Vishnu temples, flowers and tulsi (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Ocimum sanctum</i>) are used. In Siva temples, bilva (bael:
<i lang="la-x-bio">&AElig;gle Marmelos</i>) leaves are substituted for
tulsi. At the close of the worship, the Archaka gives to those present
th&#299;rtham (holy water), tulsi or bilva leaves, and vibh&#363;thi
(sacred ashes) according to the nature of the temple. At Vishnu
temples, immediately after the giving of <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e12805" title="Source: thirtham">th&#299;rtham</span>, an inverted
bowl, bearing on it the feet of Vishnu (sat&#257;ri or sadag&#333;pam),
is placed by the Archaka first on the head, and then on the right
shoulder, and again on the head, in the case of grown up and married
males, and only on the head in the case of females and young people.
The bowl is always kept near the m&#363;la vigraha, and, on festival
days, when the god is taken in procession through the streets, it is
carried along with the utsava vigraha. On festival days, such as
Dhip&#257;vali, Vaikunta Ek&#257;dasi, Dw&#257;dasi, etc., the god of
the temple is taken in procession through the main streets of the town
or village. The idol, thus borne in procession, is not the stone
figure, but the portable one made of metal (utsava vigraha), which is
usually kept in the temple in front of the M&#363;la idol. At almost
every important temple, an annual festival called Brahm&#333;tsavam,
which usually lasts ten days, is celebrated. Every night during this
festival, the god is seated on the clay, wooden or metal figure of some
animal as a vehicle, <i>e.g.</i>, Garuda, horse, elephant, bull,
Hanum&#257;n, peacock, y&#257;li, etc., and taken in procession,
accompanied by a crowd of Br&#257;hmans chanting the V&#275;das and
Tamil N&#257;layara Prapandhams, if the temple is an important one. Of
the vehicles or vah&#257;nams, Hanum&#257;n and Garuda are special to
Vishnu, and the bull (Nandi) and tiger to Siva. The others are common
to both deities. During the month of May, the festival <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>of
the god Varadar&#257;ja takes place annually. On one of the ten days of
this festival, the idol, which has gone through a regular marriage
ceremony, is placed on an elaborately decorated car (ratha), and
dragged through the main streets. The car frequently bears a number of
carved images of a very obscene nature, the object of which, it is
said, is to avert the evil eye. Various castes, besides Br&#257;hmans,
take part in temple worship, at which the saints of both Siva and
Vishnu&mdash;N&#257;yanmar and &#256;lvars&mdash;are worshipped. The
Br&#257;hmans do not entirely ignore the worship of the lower deities,
such as M&#257;riamma, Mun&#275;swara, Kodamanitaya, etc. At Udipi in
South Canara, the centre of the M&#257;dhva cult, where M&#257;dhva
preached his Dvaitic philosophy, and where there are several mutts
presided over by celibate priests, the Br&#257;hmans often make a vow
to the Bh&#363;thas (devils) of the Paravas and Nalkes. Quite recently,
we saw an orthodox Shivalli Br&#257;hman, employed under the priest of
one of the Udipi mutts, celebrating the n&#275;ma (festival) of a
bh&#363;tha named Panjurli, in fulfilment of a vow made when his son
was ill. The Nalke devil-dancers were sent for, and the dance took
place in the courtyard of the Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s house. During the
leaf festival at Periyapalayam near Madras, Br&#257;hman males and
females may be seen wearing leafy twigs of margosa (<i>Melia
Azadirachta</i>), and going round the M&#257;riamma shrine.</p>
<p>I pass on to a detailed consideration of the various classes of
Br&#257;hmans met with in Southern India. Of these, the Tamil
Br&#257;hmans, or Dr&#257;vidas proper, are most numerous in the
southern districts. They are divided into the following
sections:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><i>I. Smartha.</i>
<ul>
<li>(<i>a</i>) Vadama.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) K&#275;sigal.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) Brahacharnam.</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) Vathima or Madhema. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334"
href="#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span></li>
<li>(<i>e</i>) Ashtasahasram.</li>
<li>(<i>f</i>) D&#299;kshitar.</li>
<li>(<i>g</i>) Sh&#333;liar.</li>
<li>(<i>h</i>) Mukk&#257;ni.</li>
<li>(<i>i</i>) K&#257;niyalar.</li>
<li>(<i>j</i>) Sank&#275;thi.</li>
<li>(<i>k</i>) Prathamas&#257;ki.</li>
<li>(<i>l</i>) Gurukkal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>II. Vaishnava.</i>
<ul>
<li>A. Vadagalai (northerners).
<ul>
<li>(<i>a</i>) Sri Vaishnava.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Vaikh&#257;nasa.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) P&#257;ncharatra.</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) Hebbar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">B. Thengalai (southerners).</p>
<ul>
<li>(<i>a</i>) Sri Vaishnava.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Vaikh&#257;nasa.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) P&#257;ncharatra.</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) Hebbar.</li>
<li>(<i>e</i>) Mandya.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>I. Smartha</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) <i>Vadama.</i>&mdash;The Vadamas
claim to be superior to the other classes, but will dine with all the
sections, except Gurukkals and Prathamas&#257;kis, and, in some places,
will even eat with Prathamas&#257;kis. The sub-divisions among the
Vadamas are:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> Ch&#333;lad&#275;sa (Ch&#333;la country).</li>
<li><span>2.</span> Vadad&#275;sa (north country).</li>
<li><span>3.</span> Savayar or Sabhayar.</li>
<li><span>4.</span> &#298;nji.</li>
<li><span>5.</span> Thummagunta Dr&#257;vida.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these are Smarthas, who use as their sect mark either the
&#363;rdhvapundram (straight mark made with sandal paste) or the
circular mark, and rarely the cross lines. They worship both Siva and
Vishnu, and generally read Pur&#257;nas about Vishnu. Some Vadamas use
the Vaishnava n&#257;mam as their sect mark, and are called
Kiththun&#257;makk&#257;rar. They follow the Smartha customs in every
way. There is a common saying &ldquo;Vadamam muththi Vaishnavam,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, a Vadama ripens into a Vaishnava. This is literally true.
Some Vadama families, who put on the &#363;rdhvapundram mark, and
follow the Smartha customs, observe pollution whenever a death occurs
in certain Sri Vaishnava families. This <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb335" href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span>is because the Sri
Vaishnavas are Vadamas recently converted into Vaishnava families.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>K&#275;sigal.</i>&mdash;The K&#275;sigals, or
Hiranyak&#275;sikal (men of the silvery hair), as they are sometimes
called, closely resemble the Vadamas, but are an exclusive endogamous
unit, and highly conservative and orthodox. They are called
Hiranyak&#275;sikal or Hiranyak&#275;sis because they follow the Grihya
S&#363;tras of Hiranyak&#275;si. It is noted, in the Gazetteer of the
Tanjore district, that they &ldquo;are peculiar in all having one
common S&#363;tram called the Sathy&#257;sh&#257;da after a common
ancestor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Brahacharnam</i> (the great sect).&mdash;The
Brahacharnams are more Saivite, and more orthodox than the Vadamas.
They put on vibh&#363;ti (sacred ashes) and sandal paste horizontal
lines as their sect mark. The sub division Sathyamangalam Brahacharnam
seems, however, to be an exception, as some members thereof put on the
Vaishnavite sect mark at all times, or at least during the month of
Puratt&#257;si, which is considered sacred to the god Venkataramana of
Tirupati. The more orthodox Brahacharnams wear a single rudr&#257;ksha
bead, or a necklace of beads, and some make lingams out of these beads,
which they put on the head during worship. They generally worship five
gods, viz., Siva in the form of a lingam, spatika (crystal) lingam,
Vishnu, Gan&#275;sa, and Iswara. It is said that Brahacharnam women can
be distinguished by the mode of tying the cloth, which is not worn so
as to reach to the feet, but reaches only to just below the knees. The
Brahacharnams are sub-divided into the following sections:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> Kandramanicka.</li>
<li><span>2.</span> Milaganur.</li>
<li><span>3.</span> M&#257;ngud&#299;.</li>
<li><span>4.</span> Palavan&#275;ri or Pazhaman&#275;ri.</li>
<li><span>5.</span> Musan&#257;du.</li>
<li><span>6.</span> Kolaththur.</li>
<li><span>7.</span> Maruthanch&#275;ri.</li>
<li><span>8.</span> Sathyamangalam.</li>
<li><span>9.</span> Puthur Dr&#257;vida.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Tanjore district, that
&ldquo;one ceremony peculiar to the Milaganur Brahacharnams is that,
before the principal marriage ceremonies of the first day, a feast is
given to four married women, a widow, and a bachelor. This is called
the adrisya pendugal (invisible women) ceremony. It is intended to
propitiate four wives belonging to this sub-division, who are said to
have been cruelly treated by their mother-in-law, and cursed the class.
They are represented to have feasted a widow, and to have then
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Vathima.</i>&mdash;The Vathimas, or Madhimas, are most
numerous in the Tanjore district, and are thus described in the
Gazetteer:&mdash;&ldquo;The Vattimas are grouped into three smaller
sub-sections, of which one is called &lsquo;the eighteen village
Vattimas,&rsquo; from the fact that they profess (apparently with
truth) to have lived till recently in only eighteen villages, all of
them in this district. They have a marked character of their own, which
may be briefly described. They are generally money-lenders, and
consequently are unpopular with their neighbours, who are often blind
to their virtues and unkind to their failings. [There is a proverb that
the Vadamas are always economical, and the Vathimas always unite
together.] It is a common reproach against them that they are severe to
those who are in their debt, and parsimonious in their household
expenditure. To this latter characteristic is attributed their general
abstinence from dholl (the usual accompaniment of a Br&#257;hman meal),
and their preference for a cold supper instead of a hot meal. The women
work as hard as the men, making mats, selling buttermilk, and lending
money on their own account, and are declared to be as keen in
money-making and usury as their brothers. They, however, possess many
amiable traits. They are well known for a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb337" href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>generous hospitality
on all great occasions, and no poor guest or Br&#257;hman mendicant has
ever had reason to complain in their houses that he is being served
worse than his richer or more influential fellows. Indeed, if anything,
he fares the better for his poverty. Again, they are unusually lavish
in their entertainments at marriages; but their marriage feasts have
the peculiarity that, whatever the total amount expended, a fixed
proportion is always paid for the various items&mdash;so much per cent.
for the pandal, so much per cent. for food, and so on. Indeed it is
asserted that a beggar who sees the size of the marriage pandal will be
able to guess to a nicety the size of the present he will get. Nor,
again, at their marriages, do they haggle about the marriage
settlement, since they have a scale, more or less fixed and generally
recognised, which determines these matters. There is less keen
competition for husbands among them, since their young men marry at an
earlier age more invariably than among the other sub-divisions. The
Vattimas are clannish. If a man fails to pay his dues to one of them,
the word is passed round, and no other man of the sub-division will
ever lend his money. They sometimes unite to light their villages by
private subscription, and to see to its sanitation, and, in a number of
ways, they exhibit a corporate unity. Till quite recently they were
little touched by English education; but a notable exception to this
general statement existed in the late Sir A. Seshayya S&#257;stri, who
was of Vattima extraction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sub-divisions of the Vattimas are:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> Pathinettu Gr&#257;maththu (eighteen
villages).</li>
<li><span>2.</span> Udayalur.</li>
<li><span>3.</span> Nannilam.</li>
<li><span>4.</span> R&#257;th&#257;mangalam. According to some, this is
not a separate section, but comes under the eighteen village
section.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span></p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Ashtasahasram</i> (eight thousand).&mdash;This class
is considered to be inferior to the Brahacharnams and Vadamas. The
members thereof are, like the Brahacharnams, more Saivite than the
Vadamas. The females are said to wear their cloth very elegantly, and
with the lower border reaching so low as to cover the ankles. The
sub-divisions of the Ashtasahasrams are:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> Aththiyur.</li>
<li><span>2.</span> Arivarpade.</li>
<li><span>3.</span> Nandiv&#257;di.</li>
<li><span>4.</span> Shatkulam (six families).</li>
</ul>
<p>As their numbers are few, though the sub-divisions are endogamous,
intermarriage is not entirely prohibited.</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>D&#299;kshitar.</i>&mdash;Another name for this
section is Thillai M&#363;v&#257;yiravar, <i>i.e.</i>, the three
thousand of Thillai (now Chidambaram). There is a tradition that three
thousand people started from Benares, and, when they reached
Chidambaram, they were one short. This confused them, but they were
pacified when Siva explained that he was the missing individual. The
D&#299;kshitars form a limited community of only several hundred
families. The men, like N&#257;yars and Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hmans of
the west coast, wear the hair tuft on the front of the head. They do
not give their girls in marriage to other sections of Br&#257;hmans,
and they do not allow their women to leave Chidambaram. Hence arises
the proverb &ldquo;A Thillai girl never crosses the boundary
line.&rdquo; The D&#299;kshitars are priests of the temple of
Natar&#257;ja at Chidambaram, whereat they serve by turns. Males marry
very early in life, and it is very difficult to secure a girl for
marriage above the age of five. The tendency to marry when very young
is due to the fact that only married persons have a voice in the
management of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>the affairs of the temple, and an individual
must be married before he can get a share of the temple income. The
chief sources of income are the p&#257;v&#257;dam and kattalai (heaps
of cooked rice piled up or spread on a board), which are offered to the
god. Every D&#299;kshitar will do his best to secure clients, of whom
the best are N&#257;ttuk&#333;ttai Chettis. The clients are housed and
looked after by the D&#299;kshitars. Concerning the D&#299;kshitars,
Mr. W. Francis writes as follows<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13117src"
href="#xd21e13117" name="xd21e13117src">101</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;An
interesting feature about the Chidambaram temple is its system of
management. It has no landed or other endowments, nor any tasdik
allowance, and is the property of a class of Brahmans peculiar to the
town, who are held in far more respect than the generality of the
temple-priest Brahmans, are called D&#299;kshitars (those who make
oblations), marry only among themselves, and in appearance somewhat
resemble the N&#257;yars or Tiyans of Malabar, bringing their topknot
round to the front of their foreheads. Their ritual in the temple more
resembles that of a domestic worship than the forms commonly followed
in other large shrines. Theoretically, all the married males of the
D&#299;kshitars have a voice in the management of the temple, and a
share in its perquisites; and at present there are some 250 of such
shares. They go round the southern districts soliciting alms and
offerings for themselves. Each one has his own particular
client&egrave;le, and, in return for the alms received, he makes, on
his return, offerings at the shrine in the name of his benefactors, and
sends them now and again some holy ashes, or an invitation to a
festival. Twenty of the D&#299;kshitars are always on duty in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>temple, all the males of the community (except
boys and widowers) doing the work by turns lasting twenty days each,
until each one has been the round of all the different shrines. The
twenty divide themselves into five parties of four each, each of which
is on duty for four days at one of the five shrines at which daily
p&#363;ja is made, sleeps there at night, and becomes the owner of the
routine offerings of food made at it. Large presents of food made to
the temple as a whole are divided among all the D&#299;kshitars. The
right to the other oblations is sold by auction every twenty days to
one of the D&#299;kshitars at a meeting of the community. These
periodical meetings take place in the D&#275;va Sabha. A lamp from
Natar&#257;ja&rsquo;s shrine is brought, and placed there by a
Pand&#257;ram, and (to avoid even the appearance of any deviation from
the principle of the absolute equality of all D&#299;kshitars in the
management of the temple) this man acts as president of the meeting,
and proposals are made impersonally through him.&rdquo; As a class the
D&#299;kshitars are haughty, and refuse to acknowledge any of the
Sankarachariars as their priests, because they are almost equal to the
god Siva, who is one of them. If a Sankarachariar comes to the temple,
he is not allowed to take sacred ashes direct from the cup, as is done
at other temples to show respect to the Sany&#257;si. The
D&#299;kshitars are mostly Yejur V&#275;dis, though a few are followers
of the Rig V&#275;da. When a girl attains puberty, she goes in
procession, after the purificatory bath, to every
D&#299;kshitar&rsquo;s house, and receives presents.</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) <i>Sh&#333;liar.</i>&mdash;The Sh&#333;liars are divided

<p>Concerning the Sh&#333;liars, Mr. C. Ramachendrier writes as
follows<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13153src" href="#xd21e13153" name=
"xd21e13153src">102</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;The Sh&#333;liars of
Thiruvanakaval (in the Tanjore district) belong to the first
sub-division, and they form a separate community, devoting their time
to service in the temple. Those who make p&#363;ja to the idol are
Pradhamasakis, and are called Archakas. Those who serve as cooks, and
attend to other inferior services, are called Arya Nambi, and those who
decorate the idols taken in procession on festive occasions are termed
Therunabuttan. Archakas alone are entitled to decorate stone images in
the chief shrines of the temple, and they are also called Pandits.
According to custom, Sh&#333;lia Brahmans should wear front locks, but
some of them have adopted the custom of other Brahmans, while the
orthodox section of the community, and the Archakas of Thiruvanakaval,
speak a very low Tamil with a peculiar intonation, and they do not send
their children to English schools. Young boys are trained by their
parents in the temple service, which entitles them, even when young, to
some emoluments. There are amongst them none who have received either
Sanskrit or Tamil education. The Archakas perform p&#363;jas by turn,
and, as the Archakaship is to be conferred at a certain age by
anointment by a guru, infant marriage does not obtain among them to
such an extent as among the D&#299;kshitars of Chidambaram. They eat
with the other Smartha Brahmans, but do not intermarry. They count
about 300 in number, including women and children. There is no
intermarriage between them and the other Sh&#333;lia Brahmans. Those of
Avadayarcovil are also engaged in the service of the temple of that
name. Sh&#333;liars of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href=
"#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>other classes are to be found in
Vasishtakudy in the taluk of Vriddachallam, Vemmaniathur in the taluk
of Villupuram, and Visalur in the taluk of Kumbaconam.&rdquo; In an
article on the Sh&#333;liars,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13158src"
href="#xd21e13158" name="xd21e13158src">103</a> it is recorded that
&ldquo;they are a very intelligent people, and at the same time very
vindictive if disturbed. Chanakya, the Indian Machiavelli and the
Minister of Chandragupta, is supposed to have belonged to this caste.
His hatred of the Nanda family, and the way in which he uprooted each
and every member of that race, has been depicted in the famous Sanskrit
drama Mudrarakshasa, which belongs to the 7th century A.D. Whether on
account of his character, and under the belief that he originated from
this caste, or for some reason which is unaccountable, the Soliyas of
modern days are held as very vindictive people, as the following
proverb will show:&mdash;&rsquo;We do not want to meet with a Soliya
even in a picture.&rsquo;&rdquo; Another proverb is to the effect that
&ldquo;the kudumi (hair tuft) on the head of a Sh&#333;liar does not
shake without sufficient reason,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, it is a sign that
he is bent upon doing some mischief.</p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) <i>Mukk&#257;ni.</i>&mdash;The Mukk&#257;nis are Smarthas
confined to the Cochin and Travancore States.</p>
<p>(<i>i</i>) <i>K&#257;niy&#257;lar.</i>&mdash;Concerning the
K&#257;niy&#257;lars, Mr. Ramachendrier writes as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Kani&#257;lars form a separate class of Smartha
Brahmins, and they live in the district of Tinnevelly and some parts of
Trichinopoly. They do not intermarry with any other class of Smartha
Brahmins, but eat with them. A large number of them, though Smarthas by
birth, wear a mark on their forehead like Vyshnava Brahmins, and serve
as cooks and menial servants in the big temple at Srirangam. Their

wearing cloths, and to all appearance they would pass for Vyshnava
women. The Vyshnava Brahmins would not allow them to mess in their
houses, though they treat rice and cakes prepared by them in temples
and offered to god as pure and holy, and partake of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>j</i>) <i>Sank&#275;thi.</i>&mdash;The Sank&#275;this are
confined to the Mysore Province. They speak a very corrupt form of
Tamil, mixed with Canarese. The following account of them is given in
the Mysore Census Report, 1891. &ldquo;They are found chiefly in the
Mysore and Hassan districts. Their colonies are also found in Kadur and
Shimoga. Their number seems to have been somewhat understated; many of
them have probably returned themselves as Dravidas. So far as language
is an indication of race, the Sanketis are Tamilians, although their
dialect is more diluted with Kanarese than that of any other Kannada
ridden Tamil body. Theirs seems to have been among the earliest
immigrations into Mysore from the neighbouring Tamil country. It is
said that some 700 years ago, about 1,000 families of Smartha Brahmans
emigrated from the vicinity of Kanchi (Conjeeveram), induced doubtless
by contemporary politics. They set out in two batches towards Mysore.
They were attacked by robbers on the road, but the larger party of
about 700 families persevered in the march notwithstanding, and settled
near the village of Kausika near Hassan, whence they are distinguished
as Kausika Sanketis. Some twelve years afterwards, the other party of
300 families found a resting place at Bettadapura in the Hunsur taluk.
This branch has been called Bettadapura Sanketi. Their religious and
social customs are the same. The Kausika Sanketis occasionally take
wives from the Bettadapura section, but, when the married <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>girl
joins her husband, her connection with her parents and relatives ceases
altogether even in regard to meals. During the Coorg disturbances about
the end of the last (eighteenth) century, many young women of the
Sanketis were captured by the Kodagas (Coorgs), and some of the
captives were subsequently recovered. Their descendants are to this day
known as Sanketis of the West, or Hiriangalas. But they, and another
sub-class called Patnagere Sanketis, do not in all exceed twenty
families. The Sanketis are proverbially a hardy, intensely conservative
and industrious Brahman community. They are referred to as models for
simultaneously securing the twofold object of preserving the study of
the V&#275;das, while securing a worldly competence by cultivating
their gardens; and, short of actually ploughing the land, they are
pre-eminently the only fraction of the Brahman brotherhood who turn
their hands to the best advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>k</i>) <i>Prathamas&#257;ki.</i>&mdash;These follow the white
Yajur V&#275;da, and are hence called Sukla Yejur V&#275;dis. The white
Yajus forms the first fifteen s&#257;kas of the Yejur V&#275;da, and
this is in consequence sometimes called Prathamas&#257;ka. The
Prathamas&#257;kis are sometimes called K&#257;tyayana (followers of
K&#257;tyayana S&#363;tram), V&#257;jusaneya, and Madyandanas. The two
last names occur among their Pravara and G&#333;tra Rishis. The
Prathamas&#257;kis are found among all the linguistic sections. Among
Smarthas, &#256;ndhras, and Vaishnavas, they are regarded as inferior.
Carnataka Prathamas&#257;kis are, on the other hand, not considered
inferior by the other sections of Carnatakas. In the Tanjore district,
the Prathamas&#257;kis are said to be known as Mady&#257;na Paraiyans.
The following quaint legend is recorded in the Gazetteer of that
district:&mdash;&ldquo;The god of the Tiruvalur <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>temple was entreated by a p&#363;j&#257;ri of
this place (Koiltirum&#363;lam) to be present in the village at a
sacrifice in his (the god&rsquo;s) honour. The deity consented at
length, but gave warning that he would come in a very unwelcome shape.
He appeared as a Paraiyan (Pariah) with beef on his back, and followed
by the four V&#275;das in the form of dogs, and took his part in the
sacrifice thus accoutred and attended. All the Brahmans who were
present ran away, and the god was so incensed that he condemned them to
be Paraiyans for one hour in the day, from noon till 1 <span class=
"sc">P.M.</span>, ever afterwards. There is a class of Brahmans called
mid-day Paraiyans, who are found in several districts, and a colony of
whom reside at Sedanipuram five miles from Nannilam. It is believed
throughout the Tanjore district that the mid-day Paraiyans are the
descendants of the Brahmans thus cursed by the god. They are supposed
to expiate their defilement by staying outside their houses for an hour
and a half every day at mid-day, and to bathe afterwards; and, if they
do this, they are much respected. Few of them, however, observe this
rule, and orthodox persons will not eat with them, because of their
omission to remove the defilement. They call themselves the
Prathamasaka.&rdquo; Several versions of stories accounting for their
pollution are extant, and the following is a version given by Mr.
Ramachendrier. &ldquo;Yagnavalkiar, who was the chief disciple of
Vysampayanar, having returned with his students from pilgrimage,
represented to his priest that Yajur V&#275;da was unrivalled, and that
he and his students alone were qualified for its propagation.
Vysampayanar, feeling provoked by this assertion, which, he remarked,
implied insult to Brahmans, proposed certain penance for the offence.
Yagnavalkiar replied that he and his students had done many good deeds
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>performed many religious rites, and that they
were still to do such, and that the insult imputed to them was worthy
of little notice. Vysampayanar required Yagnavalkiar to give back the
Ved&#257;s which he had taught him, which he threw out at once. The
matter thrown out having been like cinders, Vysampayanar&rsquo;s
disciples then present, assuming the shape of thithiri birds
(fire-eating birds), swallowed them, and hence the V&#275;da is called
Thithiriya S&#257;ka and Ktishna Yajus. Soon after, Yagnavalkiar,
without his priest&rsquo;s knowledge, went to the Sun, and, offering
prayers, entreated him to teach him V&#275;das. The Sun, thereupon
taking the shape of a horse, taught him the Yajur V&#275;da, which now
forms the first fifteen s&#257;kas, and he in turn taught it to his
disciples Kanvar, Madhyandanar, Katyayanar, and Vajasaneyar. It is to
be gathered from Var&#257;ha Pur&#257;nam that Vysampayanar pronounced
a curse that the Rig V&#275;da taught by the Sun should be considered
degraded, and that the Brahmans reading it should become Chand&#257;las
(outcastes).&rdquo; Another version of the legend runs as follows.
Vaisampayanar used to visit the king almost every day, and bless him by
giving akshatha or sacred rice. One day, as Vaisampayanar could not go,
he gave the rice grains to his disciple Yagnavalkiar, and told him to
take them to the king. Accordingly, Yagnavalkiar went to the
king&rsquo;s palace, and found the throne empty. Being impatient by
nature, he left the rice grains on the throne, and returned to his
priest. The king, when he returned home, found his throne changed into
gold, and certain plants were growing round his seat. On enquiry, he
discovered that this marvellous effect was due to the sacred akshatha.
He sent word to Vaisampayanar to send the rice grains by his disciple
who had brought them. Yagnavalkiar refused, and was told to vomit
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name=
"pb347">347</a>]</span>the V&#275;das. Readily he vomited, and, going
to the Sun, learnt the V&#275;da from him. As the Sun is always in
motion sitting in his car, the V&#275;das could not be learnt without
mistakes and peculiar sounds. When he came to his Guru Vaisampayanar,
Yagnavalkiar was cursed to become a Chand&#257;la. The curse was
subsequently modified, as the Sun interceded on behalf of
Yagnavalkiar.</p>
<p>(<i>l</i>) <i>Gurukkal.</i>&mdash;The Gurukkals are all followers of
the Bodhayana S&#363;tras. They are temple priests, and other
Br&#257;hmans regard them as inferior, and will not eat with them. Even
in temples, the Gurukkals sprinkle water over the food when it is
offered to the god, but do not touch the food. They may not live in the
same quarters with other Br&#257;hmans. No agrah&#257;ram (Br&#257;hman
quarter) will ever contain a Gurukkal&rsquo;s house. There should,
strictly speaking, be at least a lane separating the houses of the
Gurukkals from those of other Br&#257;hmans. This is, however, not
rigidly observed at the present day. For example, at Shiyali, Gurukkals
and other Br&#257;hmans live in the same street. There are among the
Gurukkals the following sub-divisions:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> Tiruv&#257;langad.</li>
<li><span>2.</span> Conjeeveram.</li>
<li><span>3.</span> Tirukkazhukunram.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Tiruv&#257;langad Gurukkals mark their bodies with vibh&#363;ti
(sacred ashes) in sixteen places, viz., head, face, neck, chest, navel,
knees, two sides of the abdomen, back and hands (three places on each
hand). The other two sub-divisions mark themselves in eight places,
viz., head, face, neck, chest, knees and hands. Gurukkals who wish to
become priests have to go through several stages of initiation called
D&#299;kshai (<i>see</i> Pand&#257;ram). Gurukkals are Saivites to a
greater extent than the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href=
"#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span>Smarthas, and do not regard
themselves as disciples of Sankaracharya. Those who are orthodox, and
are temple priests, should not see the corpses of Pand&#257;rams and
other non-Br&#257;hman castes. The sight of such a corpse is supposed
to heap sin on them, and pollute them, so that they are unfit for
temple worship.</p>
<p><i>II. Vaishnava.</i>&mdash;The Vaishnavas, or Sri Vaishnavas, as
they are sometimes called to distinguish them from the M&#257;dhvas,
who are also called Vaishnavas, are all converts from Smarthas, though
they profess to constitute a distinct section. Some are converts from
Telugu Smarthas, and are called &#256;ndhra Vaishnavas. These do not
mix with other Tamil-speaking Vaishnavas, and retain some of the Telugu
customs. There are two distinct groups of Sri Vaishnavas&mdash;the
Vadagalais (northerners) and Thengalais (southerners), who are easily
distinguished by the marks on their foreheads. The Vadagalais put on a
<b>U</b>-shaped mark, and the Thengalais a <b>Y</b>-shaped mark. The
white mark is made with a kind of kaolin called tiruman, and turmeric
rendered red by means of alkali is used for the central streak. The
turmeric, as applied by the more orthodox, is of a yellow instead of
red colour. Orthodox Sri Vaishnavas are very exclusive, and hold that
they co-existed as a separate caste of Br&#257;hmans with the Smarthas.
But it was only after R&#257;m&#257;nuja&rsquo;s teaching that the
Vaishnavas seceded from the Smarthas, and the ranks were swollen by
frequent additions from amongst the Vadamas. There are some families of
Vaishnavas which observe pollution when there is a death in certain
Smartha families, which belong to the same g&#333;tra. Vaishnavas of
some places, <i>e.g.</i>, Valavanur, Savalai, and Perangiyur, in the
South Arcot district, are considered low by the orthodox sections of
Vaishnavas, because they are recent converts to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=
"pb349">349</a>]</span>Vaishnavism. A good example of Smarthas becoming
Vaishnavas is afforded by the Thummagunta Dr&#257;vidas, some of whom
have become Vaishnavas, but still take girls in marriage from Smartha
families, but do not give their daughters in marriage to Smarthas. All
Vaishnavas are expected to undergo a ceremony of initiation into
Vaishnavism after the Upanayanam ceremony. At the time of initiation,
they are branded with the marks of the chakram and sankha (chank) on
the right and left shoulders respectively. The Vaikh&#257;nasas and
P&#257;ncharatras regard the branding as unnecessary. The ceremony of
initiation (sam&#257;srayanam) is usually performed by the head of a
mutt. Sometimes, however, it is carried out by an elderly member of the
family of the candidate. Such families go by the name of Swayam
&#256;charya Purushas (those who have their own men as
&#256;charyas).</p>
<p>For Vadagalais there are two mutts. Of these, the Ahobila mutt was
formerly at Tiruvallur, but its head-quarters has been transferred to
Narasimhap&#363;ram near Kumbakonam. The Parak&#257;lasw&#257;mi mutt
is in the Mysore Province. For Thengalais there are three mutts, at
Vanamamalai and Sriperumbudur in Chingleput, and Tirukoilur in South
Arcot. These are called respectively the Toth&#257;dri,
Ethir&#257;jajhir, and Emberum&#257;nar mutts. There are various points
of difference between Vadagalais and Thengalais, which sometimes lead
to bitter quarrels in connection with temple worship. During the
procession of the god at temple festivals, both Vadagalais and
Thengalais go before and after the god, repeating Sanskrit V&#275;das
and Tamil Prapandhams respectively. Before commencing these, certain
sl&#333;kas are recited, in one of which the Vadagalais use the
expression R&#257;m&#257;nuja day&#257; p&#257;tram, and the Thengalais
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>the expression Srisail&#275;sa day&#257;
p&#257;tram, and a quarrel ensues in consequence. The main differences
between the two sections are summarised as follows in the Mysore Census
Report, 1891:&mdash;&ldquo;The tenets which form the bone of contention
between the Tengal&#275;s and Vadagal&#275;s are stated to number 18,
and seem to cluster round a few cardinal items of
controversy:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Whether Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu, is (Vibhu) co-omnipresent
and co-illimitable with Vishnu;</p>
<p>2. Whether Lakshmi is only the mediatrix for, or the co-bestower of
m&#333;ksham or final beatitude;</p>
<p>3. Whether there is any graduated m&#333;ksham attainable by the
good and blessed, according to their multifarious merits;</p>
<p>4. Whether prapatti, or unconditional surrender of the soul to god,
should be performed once for all, or after every act of spiritual
rebellion;</p>
<p>5. Whether it (prapatti) is open to all, or is prescribed only for
those specially prepared and apprenticed;</p>
<p>6. Whether the indivisibly atomic human soul is entered into, and
permeated or not by the omnipresent creator;</p>
<p>7. Whether god&rsquo;s mercy is exerted with or without cause;</p>
<p>8. Whether the same (the divine mercy) means the overlooking
(dh&#333;sha darsanam) or enjoyment (dh&#333;sha bogyatvam) of the
soul&rsquo;s delinquencies;</p>
<p>9. Whether works (karma) and knowledge (jn&#257;na) are in
themselves salvation giving, or only lead to faith (bhakthi) by which
final emancipation is attained;</p>
<p>10. Whether the good of other (unregenerate) castes should be
tolerated according to their graduated social statuses, or should be
venerated without reference to caste inequalities; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span></p>
<p>11. Whether karma (works, rituals, etc.) should or not be bodily and
wholly abandoned by those who have adopted prapatti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The points of difference between Vadagalais and Thengalais are thus
described by Mr. V. N. Narasimmiyengar<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13285src" href="#xd21e13285" name=
"xd21e13285src">104</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;The Tengal&#275; schismatists
deny to Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu, any participation in creation,
and reduce her to the position of a creature; omit to ring the bell
when worshipping their idols; salute each other and their gods only
once; make use of highly abstruse Tamil verses in room of Sanskrit
mantras and prayers; modify the sr&#257;ddha ceremony materially, and
do not shave their widows. The principal texts cited by the
Tengal&#275; Sri Vaishnavas in support of the immunity of their widows
from the rite of tonsure are the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Widows should avoid, even when in affliction and danger, shaving,
eating of sweets, betel nut, flowers, sexual intercourse, conversation
with men, and jewels (S&#257;ndilyah).</p>
<p>A woman, whether unmarried or widowed, who shaves her hair, will go
to the hell called Rauravam. When the husband dies, the widow should
perform his due obsequies without shaving. She should never shave on
any occasion, or for any purpose whatever (Sambhuh).</p>
<p>If any woman, whether unmarried or widowed, shave (her head), she
will dwell in the hell called Rauravam for one thousand karors of
kalp&#257;s. If a widow shave (her head) by ignorance, she will cause
hair to grow in the mouths of her ancestors&rsquo; ghosts on both
sides. If she perform any ceremonies inculcated by the Srutis and
Smritis with her head shaved, she will be born a Chand&#257;l&#299;
(Manuh). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is no sin in a devout widow, whose object is eternal
salvation, wearing her hair. If she should shave, she will assuredly go
to hell. A Vaishnava widow should never shave her head. If she do so
through ignorance, her face should not be looked at (Vridd&rsquo;ha
Manuh in Khag&#275;svara Samhit&#257;).</p>
<p>If any one observe a Brahmach&#257;ri beggar with his kachch&#275;
(cloth passed between the legs, and tucked in behind), a householder
without it, and a widow without hair on her head, he should at once
plunge into water with his clothes (Ananta Samhit&#257;).</p>
<p>It is considered highly meritorious for Vaishnava widows to wear
their hair, as long as they remain in this world (Hayagr&#299;va
Samhit&#257;).&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the two sects of the Vaishnavas in the Madras
Presidency, the Rev. C. E. Kennet writes as follows<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e13303src" href="#xd21e13303" name=
"xd21e13303src">105</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;While both the sects acknowledge
the Sanskrit books to be authoritative, the Vadagalai uses them to a
greater extent than the Thengalai. The former also recognises and
acknowledges the female energy as well as the male, though not in the
gross and sensual form in which it is worshipped among the Saivas, but
as being the feminine aspect of deity, and representing the grace and
merciful care of Providence; while the Tenkalai excludes its agency in
general, and, inconsistently enough, allows it co-operation in the
final salvation of a human soul. But the most curious difference
between the two schools is that relating to human salvation itself, and
is a reproduction in Indian minds of the European controversy between
Calvinists and Arminians. For the adherents of the Vadakalais strongly
insist on the concomitancy of the human will <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>for
securing salvation, whereas those of the Tenkalai maintain the
irresistability of divine grace in human salvation. The arguments from
analogy used by the two parties respectively are, however, peculiarly
Indian in character. The former adopt what is called the monkey
argument, the Markata Ny&#257;ya, for the young monkey holds on to or
grasps its mother to be conveyed to safety, and represents the hold of
the soul on God. The latter use the cat argument, the M&#257;rj&#257;la
Ny&#257;ya, which is expressive of the hold of God on the soul; for the
kitten is helpless until the mother-cat seizes it <i>nolens volens</i>,
and secures it from danger. The late Major M. W. Carr inserts in his
large collection of Telugu and Sanskrit proverbs the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The monkey and its cub. As the cub clings to its mother, so
man seeks divine aid, and clings to his God. The doctrine of the
Vadakalais.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the cat and her kitten. The stronger carrying and
protecting the weaker; used to illustrate the free grace of God. The
doctrine of the Tenkalais.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaving the speculative differences between these two sects,
I have now to mention the practical one which divides them, and which
has been, and continues to be, the principal cause of the fierce
contentions and long-drawn law suits between them. And this relates to
the exact mode of making the sectarian mark on the forehead. While both
sects wear a representation of Vishnu&rsquo;s trident, composed of red
or yellow for the middle line or prong of the trident, and of white
earth for those on each side, the followers of the Vadakalai draw the
middle line only down to the bridge of the nose, but those of the
Tenkalai draw it over the bridge a little way down the nose itself.
Each party maintain that their mode of making the mark is the right
one, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name=
"pb354">354</a>]</span>and the only means of effecting a settlement of
the dispute is to ascertain how the idol itself is marked, whether as
favouring the Vadakalai or Tenkalai. But this has been found hitherto
impossible, I am told, for instance at Conjeveram itself, the
head-quarters of these disputes, owing to the unreliable and
contradictory character of the evidence produced in the
Courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hebbar and Mandya sections belong to the Mysore Province, in
which the former are very numerous. The latter are few in number, and
confined to Mandya and Melk&#333;te. Some families have settled in the
city of Madras, where they are employed as merchants, bank clerks,
attorneys, etc.</p>
<p>The Mandyas say that they migrated to Mysore from some place near
Tirupati. Though both the Hebbar and Mandya Br&#257;hmans speak Tamil,
some details peculiar to Carnatakas are included in the marriage
ceremonial.</p>
<p>The Vaishnava Sh&#333;liars are considered somewhat low in the
social scale. Intermarriage takes place between Smartha and Vaishnavite
Sh&#333;liars. The Vaikh&#257;nasas and P&#257;ncharatras are temple
priests (archakas). Both use as their title D&#299;kshitar. Sometimes
they are called Nambi, but this term is more used to denote
S&#257;t&#257;ni temple servants.</p>
<p>Reference may here be made to the Pattar Br&#257;hmans, who are
Tamil Br&#257;hmans, who have settled in Malabar. The name is said to
be derived from the Sanskrit bhatta. It is noted, in the Gazetteer of
Malabar, that &ldquo;the Pattars present no peculiarities
distinguishing them from the ordinary East Coast Brahmans. Like the
latter, they engage in trade and business, and form a large proportion
of the official, legal, and scholastic classes. With the exception of
one class known as Ch&#333;zhiya <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355"
href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span>or &#256;rya Pattars, they
wear their kudumi (top-knot) on the back of the head in the east coast
fashion, and not on the top and hanging over the forehead, as is done
by the genuine Malay&#257;li castes. They also live as a general rule
in regular streets or gr&#257;mams on the east coast plan. Few Pattars,
except in the Palghat taluk, are large land-owners. As a class, they
have embraced modern educational facilities eagerly, so far as they
subserve their material prospects. Both Pattars and Embr&#257;ndiris,
but especially the latter, have adopted the custom of contracting
sambandham (alliance) with N&#257;yar women, but sambandham with the
foreign Brahmans is not considered to be so respectable as with
Namb&#363;diris, and, except in the Palghat taluk (where the
Namb&#363;diri is rare), they are not allowed to consort with the women
of aristocratic families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with the &#256;rya Pattars, it is recorded, in the
Travancore Census Report, 1901, that &ldquo;the term Aryapattar means
superior Brahmins. But the actual position in society is not quite
that. At R&#257;m&#275;svaram, which may be considered the seat of
Aryapattars, their present status seems to be actually inferior, due
probably, it is believed, to their unhesitating acceptance of gifts
from Sudras, and to their open assumption of their priestly charge.
Though at present a small body in Malabar, they seem to have once
flourished in considerable numbers. In the case of large exogamous but
high-caste communities like the Kshatriyas of Malabar, Brahmin husbands
were naturally in great requisition, and when, owing to their high
spiritual ideals, the Brahmins of Malabar were either Grihasthas or
Sn&#257;takas (bachelor Sany&#257;sins dedicating their life to study,
and to the performance of orthodox rites), the supply was probably
unequal to the demand. The scarcity was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb356" href="#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span>presumably added to
when the differences between the K&#333;lattun&#257;t Royal Family and
the Brahmins of the Perinchell&#363;r gr&#257;mam became so pronounced
as to necessitate the importing of Canarese and Tulu Brahmins for
priestly services at their homes and temples. The first immigration of
Brahmins from the east coast, called Aryapattars, into Malabar appears
to have been under the circumstances above detailed, and at the
instance of the Rajas of Cranganore. With the gradual lowering of the
Brahminical ideal throughout the Indian Peninsula, and with the
increasing struggle for physical existence, the Namb&#363;tiris entered
or re-entered the field, and ousted the Aryapattars first from
consortship, and latterly even from the ceremony of t&#257;li-tying in
families that could pay a Namb&#363;tiri. The Aryapattar has, in his
turn, trespassed into the ranks of the N&#257;yars, and has begun to
undertake the religious rite of marriage, <i>i.e.</i>, t&#257;li-tying,
in aristocratic families among them. There are only two families now in
all Travancore, and they live in the Karunagapalli taluk.
Malay&#257;lam is their household tongue; in dress and personal habits,
they are indistinguishable from Malay&#257;la Brahmins. The males marry
into as high a class of Brahmins as they could get in Malabar, which is
not generally higher than that of the P&#333;tti. The P&#333;tti woman
thus married gets rather low in rank on account of this alliance. The
daughter of an Aryapattar cannot be disposed of to a Brahminical caste
in Malabar. She is taken to the Tinnevelly or Madura district, and
married into the regular Aryapattar family according to the rites of
the latter. The girl&rsquo;s dress is changed into the Tamil form on
the eve of her marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>III. &#256;ndhra.</i>&mdash;The Telugu-speaking Br&#257;hmans are
all &#256;ndhras, who differ from Tamil Br&#257;hmans in some
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>of their marriage and death ceremonies, female
attire, and sectarian marks. Telugu Br&#257;hman women wear their cloth
without passing it between the legs, and the free end of the skirt is
brought over the left shoulder. The sect mark consists of three
horizontal streaks of sacred ashes on the forehead, or a single streak
of sandal paste (gandham). In the middle of the streak is a circular
black spot (akshintalu or akshintalu bottu). The marriage badge is a
circular plate of gold, called bottu, attached to a thread, on which
black glass beads are frequently strung. A second bottu, called
n&#257;gavali bottu, is tied on the bride&rsquo;s neck on the
n&#257;gavali day. During the time when the bridegroom is performing
the vrata ceremony, the bride is engaged in the worship of Gauri. She
sits in a new basket filled with paddy (unhusked rice) or cholam
(<i>Andropogon Sorghum</i>). On the return from the mock pilgrimage
(k&#257;siy&#257;tra), the bride and bridegroom sit facing each other
on the dais, with a screen interposed between them. Just before the
bottu is tied on the bride&rsquo;s neck by the bridegroom, the screen
is lowered. During the marriage ceremony, both the bride and bridegroom
wear clothes dyed with turmeric, until the n&#257;gavali day. Among
Tamil Br&#257;hmans, the bridegroom wears a turmeric-dyed cloth, and
the bride may wear a silk cloth. Immediately after the tying of the
bottu, the contracting couple throw rice over each other, and those
assembled pour rice over their heads. This is called Talambralu.</p>
<p>Taken as a class, the Telugu Br&#257;hmans are very superstitious,
and the females perform a very large number of vratams. Of the vratams
performed by Telugu and Canarese females, both Br&#257;hman and
non-Br&#257;hman, the following account is given in the Manual of the
Nellore district. A very favourite deity <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>is Gauri, in honour
of whom many of the rites hereafter noticed are performed. These
ceremonies give a vivid idea of the hopes and fears, the aspirations,
and the forebodings of Hindu womanhood. The following ceremonies are
practised by girls after betrothal, and before union with their
husbands:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Atlataddi.</i>&mdash;On the third day after the full moon, an
early meal before sunrise, the worship of Gauri in the afternoon, and

<p><i>Kandanomi.</i>&mdash;Abstaining for a year from the use of arum
(<i>Amorphophallus Campanulatus</i>), of which the corms are an article
of food), and presenting a matron <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359"
href="#pb359" name="pb359">359</a>]</span>with a silver and gold

the attainment of wealth and salvation, or to make the best of both
worlds.</p>
<p><i>Vavila Gauri D&#275;vi.</i>&mdash;In order to avert the risk of

Tuesdays of the month Sravana, worships the goddess Gauri D&#275;vi,
and distributes Bengal gram to married women.</p>
<p><i>Savitri Gauri D&#275;vi.</i>&mdash;The offering of nine different
articles on nine different days after the sun has entered the solstice,
the sign of Capricorn. This is also practised to secure a
husband&rsquo;s affection.</p>
<p><i>Tsaddikutimangalavaram.</i>&mdash;This is a piece of
self-mortification, and consists in eating on every Tuesday for one
year nothing but cold rice boiled the previous day, and feeding a

<p>The following are some of the ceremonies practised by young women
after attaining a marriageable age:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Prabatcha Adivaram.</i>&mdash;Offering worship to a married
couple, and limiting the taking of food to a single meal on Sunday.
This is done with the object of having children.</p>
<p><i>Apadal&#275;ni Adivaram.</i>&mdash;Taking but one meal every

the sacred tulasi plant (<i>Ocimum sanctum</i>), which is kept in many
Hindu households, growing on an altar of masonry. The object of this is
to restore a dead husband to life again, <i>i.e.</i>, to secure
re-union in another life.</p>
<p><i>Krishna Tulasi.</i>&mdash;To avert widowhood, those who perform
this rite present thirteen pairs of cakes in a gold cup to a

<p><i>Magha Gauri D&#275;vi.</i>&mdash;The worship of the goddess Gauri
in the month of Magham, with a view to avert widowhood. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name="pb363">363</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Vishnukanta.</i>&mdash;For the same purpose, thirteen pairs of
cakes are offered in a new pot to some married woman.</p>
<p><i>Vishnuvidia.</i>&mdash;To atone for the sin of the catamenial
discharge, food is eaten without salt on the second day after every new

moon that falls on Monday, with the giving away of 360 articles, two or
three on each occasion. This is performed with the view of attaining
atonement for sins, and happiness in a future state.</p>
<p>There are many ceremonies performed by women to whom nature has
denied the much-coveted joys of maternity. Among these may be
noted:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Asvadhapradakshinam.</i>&mdash;In villages is often to be seen a
margosa (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>)tree, round which a p&#299;pul tree
(<i>Ficus religiosa</i>) has twined itself. The ceremony consists in a
woman walking round and round this tree several times daily for a long
period.<a id="xd21e13624" name="xd21e13624"></a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sub-divisions of the Telugu Br&#257;hmans are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><i>A.&mdash;Vaidiki.</i>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> Murikin&#257;du.</li>
<li><span>2.</span> Telaganyam.</li>
<li><span>3.</span> Veln&#257;du.</li>
<li><span>4.</span> Kasaln&#257;du.</li>
<li><span>5.</span> Karnakammalu.</li>
<li><span>6.</span> Vegin&#257;du.</li>
<li><span>7.</span> Konesime.</li>
<li><span>8.</span> &#256;rama Dr&#257;vida.</li>
<li><span>9.</span> &#256;r&#257;dhya.</li>
<li><span>10.</span> Prathamas&#257;ki.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>B.&mdash;Niyogi.</i>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> &#256;ruvela.</li>
<li><span>2.</span> Nandavarikulu.</li>
<li><span>3.</span> Kammalu.</li>
<li><span>4.</span> Pesalavayalu.</li>
<li><span>5.</span> Pr&#257;ngan&#257;du.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>C.&mdash;Tambala.</i></li>
<li><i>D.&mdash;Immigrants.</i>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> Pudur Dr&#257;vida.</li>
<li><span>2.</span> Thummagunta Dr&#257;vida.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All these sections are endogamous, and will eat together, except the
Tambalas, who correspond to the Gurukkals among the Tamil
Br&#257;hmans. Vaidikis are supposed to be superior to Niy&#333;gis.
The former do not generally grow moustaches, while the latter do. For
sr&#257;dh ceremonies, Niy&#333;gis do not generally sit as
Br&#257;hmans representing the ancestors, Vaidikis being engaged for
this purpose. In some places, <i>e.g.</i>, the Nandigama t&#257;luk of
the Kistna district, the Niy&#333;gis are not referred to by the name
Br&#257;hman, Vaidikis being so called. Even Niy&#333;gis themselves
point to Vaidikis when asked about Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p>Veln&#257;du, Murikin&#257;du, and V&#275;gin&#257;du seem to be
territorial names, and they occur also among some of the
non-Br&#257;hman castes. The &#256;r&#257;dhyas are dealt with in a
special article (<i>see</i> &#256;r&#257;dhya). Among the Karnakammas
are certain sub-sections, such as &#332;g&#333;ti and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>Kolj&#275;du. They all belong to Rig S&#257;ka.
Of the Telaganyams, some follow the Rig V&#275;da, and others the Yejur
V&#275;da (both black and white Yajus). The Nandavarikulu are all Rig
V&#275;dis, and regard Chaud&#275;swari, the goddess of the
D&#275;v&#257;ngas, as their tutelary deity. When a Nandavariki
Br&#257;hman goes to a D&#275;v&#257;nga temple, he is treated with
much respect, and the D&#275;v&#257;nga priest gives up his place to
the Nandavariki for the time being. The Nandavariki Br&#257;hmans are,
in fact, gurus or priests to the D&#275;v&#275;ngas.</p>
<p>A special feature of the Telugu Br&#257;hmans is that, like the
Telugu non-Br&#257;hman classes, they have house names or
intip&#275;rulu, of which the following are examples:&mdash;K&#333;ta
(fort), Lanka (island), Puchcha (<i>Citrullus Colocynthis</i>), Chintha
(tamarind), K&#257;k&#299; (crow). Niy&#333;gi house-names sometimes
terminate with the word r&#257;zu.</p>
<p><i>IV. Carn&#257;taka.</i>&mdash;The sub-divisions of the
Carn&#257;takas or Canarese-speaking Br&#257;hmans are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><i>A.&mdash;Smartha.</i>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> Aruvaththuvokk&#257;lu.</li>
<li><span>2.</span> Badagan&#257;d&#363;.</li>
<li><span>3.</span> Hosaln&#257;du.</li>
<li><span>4.</span> Hoisanige or Vaishanige.</li>
<li><span>5.</span> Kamme (Bobburu, Karna, and Ulcha).</li>
<li><span>6.</span> S&#299;rn&#257;du.</li>
<li><span>7.</span> M&#257;raka.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>B.&mdash;M&#257;dhva.</i>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> Aruv&#275;la.</li>
<li><span>2.</span> Aruvaththuvokkalu.</li>
<li><span>3.</span> Badagan&#257;du.</li>
<li><span>4.</span> Pennathth&#363;rar.</li>
<li><span>5.</span> Prathamas&#257;ki.</li>
<li><span>6.</span> Hyderabadi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Carn&#257;takas very closely resemble the &#256;ndhras in their
ceremonial observances, and, like them, attach much importance to
vratams. The M&#257;dhva Carn&#257;takas are recent converts from
Carn&#257;taka or &#256;ndhra Smarthas. The Pennathth&#363;rars are
supposed to be Tamil Br&#257;hmans converted into M&#257;dhvas. They
retain some of the customs peculiar to the Tamil Br&#257;hmans. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>marriage badge, for example, is the Tamil
t&#257;li and not the bottu. Intermarriages between Smarthas and
M&#257;dhvas of the same section are common. M&#257;dhvas, excepting
the very orthodox, will take food with both Carn&#257;taka and
&#256;ndhra Smarthas.</p>
<p>The M&#257;rakas are thus described by Mr. Lewis Rice.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e13812src" href="#xd21e13812" name=
"xd21e13812src">106</a> &ldquo;A caste claiming to be Br&#257;hmans,
but not recognised as such. They worship the Hindu triad, but are
chiefly Vishnuvites, and wear the trident mark on their foreheads. They
call themselves Hale Kannadiga or Hale Karn&#257;taka, the name
Marka<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13815src" href="#xd21e13815" name=
"xd21e13815src">107</a> being considered as one of reproach, on which
account also many have doubtless returned themselves as Br&#257;hmans
of one or other sect. They are said to be descendants of some disciples
of Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya, the original guru of Sring&#275;ri, and the
following legend is related of the cause of their expulsion from the
Br&#257;hman caste to which their ancestors belonged. One day
Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya, wishing to test his disciples, drank some
toddy in their presence, and the latter, thinking it could be no sin to
follow their master&rsquo;s example, indulged freely in the same
beverage. Soon after, when passing a butcher&rsquo;s shop,
Sank&#257;rach&#257;rya asked for alms; the butcher had nothing but
meat to give, which the guru and his disciples ate. According to the
Hindu sh&#257;stras, red-hot iron alone can purify a person who has
eaten flesh and drunk toddy. Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya went to a
blacksmith&rsquo;s furnace, and begged from him some red-hot iron,
which he swallowed and was purified. The disciples were unable to
imitate their master in the matter of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb368" href="#pb368" name="pb368">368</a>]</span>the red-hot iron, and
besought him to forgive their presumption in having dared to imitate
him in partaking of forbidden food. Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya refused to
give absolution, and cursed them as unfit to associate with the six
sects of Br&#257;hmans. The caste is making a strong effort to be
readmitted among Br&#257;hmans, and some have recently become disciples
of Parak&#257;lasw&#257;mi. Their chief occupations are agriculture,
and Government service as sh&#257;nbogs or village accountants.&rdquo;
It is recorded, in the Mysore Census Report, 1891, that &ldquo;some of
the more intelligent and leading men in the clan give another
explanation (of the legend). It is said that either in Dew&#257;n
P&#363;rnaiya&rsquo;s time, or some time before, a member of this
micro-caste rose to power, and persecuted the people so mercilessly
that, with characteristic inaptitude, they gave him the nickname
M&#257;raka or the slaughterer or destroyer, likening him to the planet
Mars, which, in certain constellations, is astrologically dreaded as
wielding a fatal influence on the fortunes of mortals. There is,
however, no doubt that, in their habits, customs, religion and
ceremonials, these people are wholly Br&#257;hmanical, but still they
remain entirely detached from the main body of the Br&#257;hmans. Since
the census of 1871, the Hal&#275; Kannadigas have been strenuously
struggling to get themselves classified among the Br&#257;hmans. About
25 years ago, the Sr&#299;ng&#275;ri Math issued on behalf of the
Smarta portion of the people a Sr&#299;mukh (papal bull) acknowledging
them to be Br&#257;hmans. A similar pronouncement was also obtained
from the Parak&#257;l Math at Mysore about three years later on behalf
of the Sr&#299;vaishnavas among them. And the Local Government
directed, a little after the census of 1881, that they should be
entered as Br&#257;hmans in the Government accounts.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span></p>
<p>The M&#257;dhva Br&#257;hmans commence the marriage ceremony by
asking the ancestors of the bridal couple to bless them, and be present
throughout the performance of the rites. To represent the ancestors, a
ravike (bodice) and dhotra (man&rsquo;s cloth) are tied to a stick,
which is placed near the box containing the s&#257;lagr&#257;ma stone
and household gods. In consequence of these ancestors being
represented, orthodox Vaidiki Br&#257;hmans refuse to take food in the
marriage house. When the bridegroom is conducted to the marriage booth
by his future father-in-law, all those who have taken part in the
K&#257;siy&#257;tra ceremony, throw rice over him. A quaint ceremony,
called rangavriksha (drawing), is performed on the morning of the
second day. After the usual playing with balls of flowers (nalagu or
nalangu), the bridegroom takes hold of the right hand of the bride,
and, after dipping her right forefinger in turmeric and chunam (lime)
paste, traces on a white wall the outline of a plantain tree, of which
a sketch has previously been made by a married woman. The tracing goes
on for three days. First the base of the plant is drawn, and, on the
evening of the third day, it is completed by putting in the flower
spikes. On the third night the bridegroom is served with sweets and
other refreshments by his mother-in-law, from whose hands he snatches
the vessels containing them. He picks out what he likes best, and
scatters the remainder about the room. The pollution caused thereby is
removed by sprinkling water and cow-dung, which is done by the cook
engaged for the marriage by the bridegroom&rsquo;s family. After
washing his hands, the bridegroom goes home, taking with him a silver
vessel, which he surreptitiously removes from near the gods. Along with
this vessel he is supposed to steal a rope for drawing water,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370</a>]</span>and a rice-pounding stone. But in practice he
only steals the vessel, and the other articles are claimed by his
people on their return home.</p>

<p>Branding for religious purposes is confined to Sr&#299; Vaishnavas
and M&#257;dhvas. Sr&#299; Vaishnava Br&#257;hmans are expected to
undergo this ordeal at least once during their life-time, whereas
M&#257;dhva Br&#257;hmans have to submit to it as often as they visit
their guru (head of a mutt). Of men of other castes, those who become
followers of a Vaishnava or M&#257;dhva &#256;ch&#257;rya (guru) or
mutt, are expected to present themselves before the guru for the
purpose of being branded. But the ceremony is optional, and not
compulsory as in the case of the Br&#257;hmans. Among Sr&#299;
Vaishnavites, the privilege of branding is confined to the elder
members of a family, Sany&#257;sis (ascetics), and the heads of the
various mutts. All individuals, male and female, must be branded, after
the Upanayanam ceremony in the case of males, and after marriage in the
case of females. The disciples, after a purificatory bath and worship
of their gods, proceed to the residence of the &#256;ch&#257;rya or to
the mutt, where they are initiated into their religion, and branded
with the chakra on the right shoulder and chank on the left. The
initiation consists in imparting to the disciple, in a very low tone,
the M&#363;la Mantram, the word N&#257;monar&#257;yan&#257;ya, the
sacred syllable &#332;m, and a few mantrams from the Brahma Rahasyam
(secrets about god). A person who has not been initiated thus is
regarded as unfit to take part in the ceremonies which have to be
performed by Br&#257;hmans. Even close relations, if orthodox, will
refuse to take food prepared or touched by the uninitiated. Concerning
M&#257;dhvas, Monier Williams writes as follows<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13833src" href="#xd21e13833" name="xd21e13833src">108</a>:
&ldquo;They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span>firmly believe that it is a duty of Vaishnavas
to carry throughout life a memorial of their god on their persons, and
that such a lasting outward and visible sign of his presence helps them
to obtain salvation through him. &lsquo;On his right armlet the
Br&#257;hman wears the discus, on his left the conch shell.&rsquo; When
I was at Tanjore, I found that one of the successors of M&#257;dhva had
recently arrived on his branding visitation. He was engaged throughout
the entire day in stamping his disciples, and receiving fees from all
according to their means.&rdquo; M&#257;dhvas have four mutts to which
they repair for the branding ceremony, viz., Vayasaraya, Sumathendra
and Mulabagal in Mysore, and Uttar&#257;ja in South Canara. The
followers of the Utt&#257;raja mutt are branded in five places in the
case of adult males, and boys after the thread investiture. The
situations and emblems selected are the chakra on the right upper arm,
right side of the chest, and above the navel; the chank on the left
shoulder and left side of the chest. Women, and girls after marriage,
are branded with the chakra on the right forearm, and the chank on the
left. In the case of widows, the marks are impressed on the shoulders
as in the case of males. The disciples of the three other mutts are
generally branded with the chakra on the right upper arm, and chank on
the left. As the branding is supposed to remove sins committed during
the interval, they get it done every time they see their guru. There is
with M&#257;dhvas no restriction as to the age at which the ceremony
should be performed. Even a new-born babe, after the pollution period
of ten days, must receive the mark of the chakra, if the guru should
turn up. Boys before the upanayanam, and girls before marriage, are
branded with the chakra on the abdomen just above the navel. The copper
or brass branding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372"
name="pb372">372</a>]</span>instruments (mudras) are not heated to a
very high temperature, but sufficient to singe the skin, and leave a
deep black mark in the case of adults, and a light mark in that of
young people and babies. In some cases, disciples, who are afraid of
being hurt, bribe the person who heats the instruments; but, as a rule,
the guru regulates the temperature so as to suit the individual. If,
for example, the disciple is a strong, well-built man, the instruments
are well heated, and, if he is a weakling, they are allowed to cool
somewhat before their application. If the operator has to deal with
babies, he presses the instrument against a wet rag before applying it
to the infant&rsquo;s skin. Some Matathipathis (head priests of the
mutt) are, it is said, inclined to be vindictive, and to make a very
hot application of the instruments, if the disciple has not paid the
fee (guruk&#257;nika) to his satisfaction. The fee is not fixed in the
case of Sri Vaishnavas, whereas M&#257;dhvas are expected to pay from
one to three months&rsquo; income for being branded. Failure to pay is
punished with excommunication on some pretext or other. The area of
skin branded generally peels off within a week, leaving a pale mark of
the mudra, which either disappears in a few months, or persists
throughout life. M&#257;dhvas should stamp mudras with g&#333;pi paste
(white kaolin) daily on various parts of the body. The names of these
mudras are chakra, chank or sankha, g&#257;tha (the weapon of war used
by Bh&#299;ma, one of the P&#257;ndavas), padma (lotus), and
Nar&#257;yana. The chakra is stamped thrice on the abdomen above the
navel, twice on the right flank, twice on the right side of the chest
above the nipple, twice on the right arm, once on the right temple,
once on the left side of the chest, and once on the left arm. The chank
is stamped twice on the right side of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb373" href="#pb373" name="pb373">373</a>]</span>chest, in two places
on the left arm, and once on the left temple. The g&#257;tha is stamped
in two places on the right arm, twice on the chest, and in one spot on
the forehead. The padma is stamped twice on the left arm, and twice on
the left side of the chest. Nar&#257;yana is stamped on all places
where other mudra marks have been made. Sometimes it is difficult to
put on all the marks after the daily morning bath. In such cases, a
single mudra mark, containing all the five mudras, is made to suffice.
Some regard the chakra mudra as sufficient on occasions of
emergency.</p>
<p>The god Hanum&#257;n (the monkey god) is specially reverenced by
M&#257;dhvas, who call him Mukyapr&#257;nad&#275;varu (the chief
god).</p>

by Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13876src" href=
"#xd21e13876" name="xd21e13876src">109</a>:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Tulu Brahmin chronicles agree in ascribing the creation
of Malabar and Canara, or K&#275;rala, Tuluva, and Haiga, to Parasu
R&#257;ma, who reclaimed from the sea as much land as he could cover by
hurling his battle-axe from the top of the Western Ghauts. According to
Tulu traditions, after a quarrel with Brahmins who used to come to him
periodically from Ahi-Ksh&#275;tra, Parasu R&#257;ma procured new
Brahmins for the reclaimed tract by taking the nets of some fishermen,
and making a number of Brahminical threads, with which he invested
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>the fishermen, and thus turned them into
Brahmins, and retired to the mountains to meditate, after informing
them that, if they were in distress and called on him, he would come to
their aid. After the lapse of some time, during which they suffered no
distress, they were curious to know if Parasu R&#257;ma would remember
them, and called upon him in order to find out. He promptly appeared,
but punished their thus mocking him by cursing them, and causing them
to revert to their old status of Sudras. After this, there were no
Brahmins in the land till Tulu Brahmins were brought from
Ahi-Ksh&#275;tra by May&#363;r Varma of the Kadamba dynasty. A modified
form of the tradition states that Parasu R&#257;ma gave the newly
reclaimed land to N&#257;ga and Machi Brahmins, who were not true
Brahmins, and were turned out or destroyed by fishermen and Holeyas
(Pariahs), who held the country till the Tulu Brahmins were introduced
by May&#363;r Varma. All traditions unite in attributing the
introduction of the Tulu Brahmins of the present day to May&#363;r
Varma, but they vary in details connected with the manner in which they
obtained a firm footing in the land. One account says that
Hab&#257;shika, chief of the Koragas (Pariahs), drove out May&#363;r
Varma, but was in turn expelled by May&#363;r Varma&rsquo;s son, or
son-in-law, L&#333;k&#257;ditya of G&#333;karnam, who brought Brahmins
from Ahi-Ksh&#275;tra and settled them in thirty-two villages. Another
makes May&#363;r Varma himself the invader of the country, which till
then had remained in the possession of the Holeyas (Pariahs) and
fishermen who had turned out Parasu R&#257;ma&rsquo;s Brahmins.
May&#363;r Varma and the Brahmins whom he had brought from
Ahi-Ksh&#275;tra were again driven out by Nanda, a Holeya chief, whose
son Chandra Sayana had, however, learned respect for Brahmins from his
mother, who had been a dancing-girl <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb375" href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>in a temple. His
admiration for them became so great that he not only brought back the
Brahmins, but actually made over all his authority to them, and reduced
his people to the position of slaves. A third account makes Chandra
Sayana, not a son of a Holeya king, but a descendant of May&#363;r
Varma and a conqueror of the Holeya king. Nothing is known from other
sources of L&#333;k&#257;ditya, Hab&#257;shika, or Chandra Sayana, but
inscriptions speak to May&#363;r Varma being the founder of the dynasty
of the Kadambas of Banav&#257;si in North Canara. His date is usually
put down at about 750 A.D. The correctness of the traditions, which
prevail in Malabar as well as in Canara, assigning the introduction of
Brahmins to the West Coast to May&#363;r Varma who was in power about
750 A.D., is to some extent corroborated by the fact that Brahmins
attested the Malabar Perumal&rsquo;s grant to the Christians in 774
A.D., but not that to the Jews about 700 A.D. The Brahmins are said to
have been brought from Ahi-Ksh&#275;tra, on the banks of the
G&#333;d&#257;vari, but it is not clear what connection a Kadamba of
Banav&#257;si could have with the banks of the G&#333;d&#257;vari, and
there may be something in the suggestion made in the North Kanara
Gazetteer that Ahi-Ksh&#275;tra is merely a sanskritised form of Haiga
or the land of snakes. The tradition speaks of the Brahmins having been
brought by L&#333;k&#257;ditya from G&#333;karnam, which is in the
extreme north of Haiga, and in the local history of the Honalli Matha
in Sunda in North Canara, G&#333;karnam is spoken of as being
Ahi-Ksh&#275;tra. G&#333;karnam is believed to have been a Brahmin
settlement in very early times, and there was probably a further influx
of Brahmins there as Muhammadan conquest advanced in the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The class usually styled Tulu Brahmins at the present day are
the Shivalli Brahmins, whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href=
"#pb376" name="pb376">376</a>]</span>head-quarters are at Udipi, and
who are most numerous in the southern part of the district, but the
K&#333;ta, K&#333;t&#275;shwar, and Haiga or Hav&#299;ka Brahmins are
all branches of the same, the differences between them having arisen
since their settlement in Canara; and, though they now talk Canarese in
common with the people of other parts to the north of the S&#299;tanadi
river, their religious works are still written in the old
Tulu-Malay&#257;lam character. Tulu Brahmins, who have settled in
Malabar in comparatively late years, are known as Embr&#257;ntris, and
treated as closely allied to the Namb&#363;tiris, whose traditions go
back to May&#363;r Varma. Some families of Shivalli and Hav&#299;ka
Brahmins in the southern or Malay&#257;lam portion of the district talk
Malay&#257;lam, and follow many of the customs of the Malabar or
Namb&#363;tiri Brahmins. Many of the thirty-two villages in which the
Brahmins are said to have been settled by May&#363;r Varma are still
the most important centres of Brahminism. Notably may be mentioned
Shivalli or Udipi, K&#333;ta and K&#333;t&#275;shwar, which have given
names to the divisions of Tulu Brahmins of which these villages are
respectively the head-quarters. When the Brahmins were introduced by
May&#363;r Varma they are said to have been followers of
Bhatt&#257;ch&#257;rya, but they soon adopted the tenets of the great
Malay&#257;lam V&#275;d&#257;ntic teacher Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya, who
is ordinarily believed to have been born at Cranganore in Malabar in
the last quarter of the eighth century, that is, soon after the arrival
of the Brahmins on the west coast. Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya is known as
the preacher of the Advaita (non-dual) philosophy, which, stated
briefly, is that all living beings are one with the supreme spirit, and
absorption may finally be obtained by the constant renunciation of
material in favour of spiritual pleasure. This philosophy, however, was
not sufficient for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href=
"#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span>common multitude, and his system
included, for weaker minds, the contemplation of the first cause
through a multitude of inferior deities, and, as various manifestations
of Siva and his consort Parvati, he found a place for all the most
important of the demons worshipped by the early Dravidians whom the
Brahmins found on the West Coast, thus facilitating the spread of
Hinduism throughout all classes. That the conversion of the Bants and
Billavas, and other classes, took place at a very early date may be
inferred from the fact that, though the great bulk of the Tulu Brahmins
of South Canara adopted the teaching of the Vaishnavite reformer
M&#257;dhav&#257;ch&#257;rya, who lived in the thirteenth century, most
of the non-Brahmin Hindus in the district class themselves as Shaivites
to this day. Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya founded the Sring&#275;ri Matha in
Mysore near the borders of the Udipi taluk, the guru of which is the
spiritual head of such of the Tulu Brahmins of South Canara as have
remained Smarthas or adherents of the teaching of
Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya. M&#257;dhav&#257;ch&#257;rya is believed to
have been born about 1199 A.D. at Kali&#257;npur, a few miles from
Udipi. He propounded the Dvaita or dual philosophy, repudiating the
doctrine of oneness and final absorption held by ordinary Vaishnavites
as well as by the followers of Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya. The attainment
of a place in the highest heaven is to be secured, according to
M&#257;dhav&#257;ch&#257;rya&rsquo;s teaching, not only by the
renunciation of material pleasure, but by the practice of virtue in
thought, word and deed. The moral code of M&#257;dhav&#257;ch&#257;rya
is a high one, and his teaching is held by some&mdash;not ordinary
Hindus of course&mdash;to have been affected by the existence of the
community of Christians at Kali&#257;npur mentioned by Cosmos Indico
Pleustes in the seventh century. M&#257;dhav&#257;ch&#257;rya placed
the worship <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378</a>]</span>of Vishnu above that of Siva, but there is
little bitterness between Vaishnavites and Shaivites in South Canara,
and there are temples in which both are worshipped under the name of
Shankara N&#257;r&#257;yana. He denied that the spirits worshipped by
the early Dravidians were manifestations of Siva&rsquo;s consort, but
he accorded sanction to their worship as supernatural beings of a lower
order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shivalli Brahmins. The Tulu-speaking Brahmins of the present
day are almost all followers of M&#257;dhav&#257;ch&#257;rya, though a
few remain Smarthas, and a certain number follow what is known as the
Bhagavat Samprad&#257;yam, and hold that equal honour is due to both
Vishnu and Siva. They are now generally called Shivalli Brahmins, their
head-quarters being at Udipi or Shivalli, a few miles from
M&#257;dhav&#257;ch&#257;rya&rsquo;s birth-place. Here
M&#257;dhav&#257;ch&#257;rya is said to have resided for some time, and
composed thirty-seven controversial works, after which he set out on a
tour. The temple of Krishna at Udipi is said to have been founded by
M&#257;dhav&#257;ch&#257;rya himself, who set up in it the image of
Krishna originally made by Arjuna, and miraculously obtained by him
from a vessel wrecked on the coast of Tuluva. In it he also placed one
of the three s&#257;lagr&#257;ms presented to him by the sage V&#275;da
Vy&#257;sa. Besides the temple at Udipi, he established eight Mathas or
sacred houses, each presided over by a sany&#257;si or sw&#257;mi.
[Their names are Sodh&#275;, Krishn&#257;pur, S&#299;rur, K&#257;nur,
P&#275;j&#257;var, Adamar, Palamar, and Puththige.] These exist to this
day, and each sw&#257;mi in turn presides over the temple of Krishna
for a period of two years, and spends the intervening fourteen years
touring through Canara and the adjacent parts of Mysore, levying
contributions from the faithful for his next two years of office, which
are very heavy, as he has to defray not only the expenses <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name="pb379">379</a>]</span>of
public worship and of the temple and Matha establishments, but must
also feed every Brahmin who comes to the place. The following
description of a Matha visited by Mr. Walhouse<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13902src" href="#xd21e13902" name="xd21e13902src">110</a> gives a
very good idea of what one of these buildings is like: &lsquo;The
building was two-storeyed, enclosing a spacious quadrangle round which
ran a covered verandah or cloister; the wide porched entrance opened
into a fine hall supported by massive pillars with expanding capitals
handsomely carved; the ceiling was also wooden, panelled and ornamented
with rosettes and pendants as in baronial halls, and so were the solid
doors. Within these was an infinity of rooms, long corridors lined with
windowless cells, apartments for meditation and study, store-rooms
overflowing with all manner of necessaries, granaries, upper rooms with
wide projecting windows latticed instead of glass with pierced
wood-work in countless tasteful patterns, and in the quadrangle there
was a draw-well and small temple, while a large yard behind contained
cattle of all kinds from a goat to an elephant. All things needful were
here gathered together. Outside sat pilgrims, poor devotees, and
beggars waiting for the daily dole, and villagers were continually
arriving with grain, vegetables, etc.&rsquo; The periodical change of
the sw&#257;mi presiding over the temple of Krishna is the occasion of
a great festival known as the Pariy&#257;ya, when Udipi is filled to
overflowing by a large concourse of M&#257;dhvas, not only from the
district but from more distant parts, especially from the Mysore
territory. [A very imposing object in the temple grounds, at the time
of my visit in 1907, was an enormous stack of fire-wood for temple
purposes.] The following is a description<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e13905src" href="#xd21e13905" name="xd21e13905src">111</a> of a
festival at the Udipi <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href=
"#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>Krishna temple witnessed by Mr.
Walhouse: &lsquo;Near midnight, when the moon rode high in a cloudless
heaven, his (Krishna&rsquo;s) image&mdash;not the very sacred one,
which may not be handled, but a smaller duplicate&mdash;was brought
forth by four Brahmins and placed under a splendid canopy on a platform
laid across two large canoes. The whole square of the tank (pond) was
lit up by a triple line of lights. Small oil cressets at close
intervals, rockets and fireworks ascended incessantly, and the barge,
also brilliantly lit up, and carrying a band of discordant music, and
Brahmins fanning the image with silver fans, was punted round and round
the tank amid loud acclamations. After this, the image was placed in a
gorgeous silver-plated beaked palanquin, and borne solemnly outside the
temple to the great idol car that stood dressed up and adorned with an
infinity of tinsel, flags, streamers and flower wreaths. On this it was
lifted, and placed in a jewel shrine amidst a storm of applause and
clapping of hands&mdash;these seem the only occasions when Hindus do
clap hands&mdash;and then, with all the company of Brahmins headed by
the sw&#257;mis marching in front, followed by flambeaus and wild
music, the car was slowly hauled by thousands of votaries round the
square which was illuminated by three lines of lights, ascending at
intervals into pyramids. A pause was made half-way, when there was a
grand display of rockets, fire fountains and wheels, and two lines of
camphor and oiled cotton laid along the middle of the road were kindled
and flamed up brilliantly. Then the car moved on to the entrance of the
temple, and the god&rsquo;s outing was accomplished.&rsquo; Another
famous temple of the Shivallis is Subramanya at the foot of the ghauts
on the Coorg border, and here also M&#257;dhav&#257;ch&#257;rya
deposited one of V&#275;da Vy&#257;sa&rsquo;s s&#257;lagr&#257;ms. It
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name=
"pb381">381</a>]</span>existed before his time, however, and, as the
name indicates, it is dedicated to the worship of Siva. In addition to
this, it is the principal centre of serpent worship in the
district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the Shivalli Brahmins are fair complexioned with
well-cut intelligent features. A number of them own land which they
cultivate by tenants or by hired labourers, and there are several
wealthy families with large landed properties, but the great bulk of
them are either astronomers, astrologers, tantris, purohitas,
worshippers in temples, or professional beggars. They have been
backward in availing themselves of English education, and consequently
not many of them are to be found holding important posts under
Government or in the professions, but a few have come to the front in
late years. A good many of them are village accountants and teachers in
village schools. The women, as is usually the case among all classes,
are fairer than the men. Their education is even more limited, but they
are said to be well trained for the discharge of household and
religious duties. They wear the cloth falling as low as the feet in
front, but not usually so low behind, especially on festive occasions,
the end being passed between the legs and tucked into the fold of the
cloth round the waist. Like all Brahmin women in Canara, they are fond
of wearing sweet-scented flowers in their hair. The language of the
Shivalli Brahmins is Tulu, except to the north of the S&#299;tanadi
river, where close intercourse with the ruling Canarese classes above
the ghauts for several centuries has led to the adoption of that
language by all classes. Their religious books are in Sanskrit, and,
even north of the S&#299;tanadi river, they are written in the old
Tulu-Malay&#257;lam character. Their houses are all neat, clean, and
provided with verandahs, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href=
"#pb382" name="pb382">382</a>]</span>and a yard in front, in which
stands, in a raised pot, a plant of the tulasi or sacred basil. Some of
the houses of the old families are really large and substantial
buildings, with an open courtyard in the centre. Men and widows bathe
the whole body every day before breakfast, but married women bathe only
up to the neck, it being considered inauspicious for them to bathe the
head also. In temples and religious houses, males bathe in the evening
also. An oil bath is taken once a week. They are, of course, abstainers
from animal food and spirituous liquors, and a prohibition extends to
some other articles, such as onions, garlic, mushrooms, etc. At times
of marriages, deaths or initiations, it is usual to give feasts, which
may be attended by all Dr&#257;vida Brahmins. The Shivallis have 252
g&#333;tras, and the names of the following seem to be of totemistic
origin:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Kudrett&#257;ya, from kudre, a horse, taya, belonging to.</li>
<li>T&#257;lit&#257;ya, palmyra palm.</li>
<li>Man&#333;lit&#257;ya, name of a vegetable.</li>
<li>Shunnat&#257;ya, chunam, lime.</li>
<li>Kalambit&#257;ya, a kind of box.</li>
<li>Nellit&#257;ya, the Indian gooseberry.</li>
<li>G&#333;li, banyan tree.</li>
<li>&#256;ne, elephant.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;These names were obtained from one of the eight sw&#257;mis
or gurus of the Udipi math, and according to him they have no
totemistic force at the present day. Girls must be married before
maturity, and the ordinary age now-a-days is between five and eleven.
The age of the bridegroom is usually between fifteen and five and
twenty. A maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter can be married without
consulting any horoscope, and during the marriage ceremonies it is
customary for a bridegroom&rsquo;s sister to obtain from him a formal
promise that, if he has a daughter, he will give her in marriage to her
son. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=
"pb383">383</a>]</span>Widows take off all their ornaments, and wear a
red or white cloth. They ought not to attend any auspicious ceremonies
or festivals, but of late years there has been a tendency to relax the
severity of the restrictions on a widow&rsquo;s freedom, and a young
widow is allowed to keep her head unshaven, and to wear a few
ornaments. A few Shivallis in the Malay&#257;lam-speaking portion of
the K&#257;sarag&#333;d taluk follow the customs and manners of the
Malay&#257;lam Brahmins, and amongst these a girl does not lose caste
by remaining unmarried until she comes of age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;K&#333;t&#275;shwar Brahmins are a small body, who take their
name from K&#333;t&#275;shwar in the Coondapoor taluk. They are
practically the same as the Shivalli Brahmins, except that, like all
classes in that taluk, they talk Canarese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hav&#299;ka, Hav&#299;ga, or Haiga Brahmins are the
descendants of the section of the Brahmins brought in by May&#363;r
Varma, who settled within the tract known as Haiga, which comprised the
southern part of North Canara and the extreme northern part of South
Canara. They did not, like the Shivallis, adopt the teaching of
M&#257;dhav&#257;ch&#257;rya, but remained followers of
Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya, and they now speak Canarese, though their
religious and family records are written in old Tulu-Malay&#257;lam
character. Though originally of the same stock, a distinction has
arisen between them and the Shivalli Brahmins, and they do not
intermarry, though they may eat together. A number of Hav&#299;ka
Brahmins are to be found scattered throughout South Canara, engaged for
the most part in the cultivation of areca palm gardens, in which they
are very expert. A very well-to-do colony of them is to be found in the
neighbourhood of Vittal in the K&#257;sarag&#333;d taluk, where they
grow <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name=
"pb384">384</a>]</span>areca nuts which are valued only second to those
grown in the m&#257;gane of the Coondapoor taluk above the ghauts. The
Hav&#299;ka Brahmins, perhaps owing to their residing for many
generations in the comparatively cool shade of the areca nut gardens,
are specially fair even for west coast Brahmins. This fairness of
complexion is particularly noticeable in the women, who do not differ
much in their manners and customs from the Shivalli Brahmin women,
except that they take a prominent part in the work of the gardens, and
never on any occasion wear the end of their cloth passed through the
legs and tucked up behind. The Hav&#299;k widows are allowed more
freedom than in most other classes. Some Hav&#299;k Brahmins in the
Malay&#257;lam portion of the K&#257;sarag&#333;d taluk have, like the
Shivallis in the same locality, adopted the language and customs of the
Malay&#257;li Brahmins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;K&#333;ta Brahmins, so called from a village in the northern
part of the Udipi taluk, are, like the Hav&#299;ks, Smarthas or
followers of Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya, and now speak Canarese, but the
breach between them and the Shivallis is not so wide, as intermarriages
occasionally take place. In the Coondapoor taluk and the northern part
of the Udipi taluk, the K&#333;tas occupy a place in the community
corresponding to that taken by the Shivallis throughout the rest of the
district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sakl&#257;puris, of whom there are a few in the district, are
what may be called a dissenting sect of Hav&#299;kas who, a few years
ago, renounced their allegiance to the R&#257;mchandrapura matha in
favour of one at Sakl&#257;puri near the boundary between North and
South Canara. Like the Hav&#299;kas, they speak Canarese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kand&#257;varas obtain their name from the village of
Kand&#257;var in the Coondapoor taluk. They are commonly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385</a>]</span>known as Udapas, and they all belong to one
g&#333;tram, that of Visvamitra. They are, therefore, precluded from
marrying within the caste, and take their wives and husbands from the
ranks of the Shivalli Brahmins. They are, indeed, said to be the
descendants of a Shivalli Brahmin who settled in Kand&#257;var about
seven or eight centuries ago. The head of the Annu Udapa family, which
is called after this ancestor, is the hereditary head of the caste, and
presides over all panch&#257;yats or caste councils. They speak
Canarese. Their title is Udapa or Udpa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Br&#257;hmans of South Canara, Mr. T. Raghaviah
writes as follows<a class="noteref" id="xd21e13956src" href=
"#xd21e13956" name="xd21e13956src">112</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;The
sentimental objection to manual labour, which is so predominant in the
East Coast Brahmin, and the odium attached to it in this country, which
has crystallised into the religious belief that, if a Brahmin
cultivates with his own hand, the fire of his hand would burn down all
that he touches, have entirely disappeared in South Canara. In the
rural parts of the district, and especially at the foot of the Western
Ghauts, it is an exceedingly common sight to see Brahmins engaging
themselves in digging, ploughing or levelling their lands, trimming
their water-courses or ledges, raising anicuts across streams, and
doing a hundred other items of manual work connected with agriculture.
Brahmin women busy themselves with cutting green leaves for manure,
making and storing manure and carrying it to their lands or trees, and
Brahmin boys are employed in tending and grazing their own cattle. This
is so much the case with a class of Brahmins called Hav&#299;ks that
there is a proverb that none but a Hav&#299;k can raise an areca
garden. You find, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386"
name="pb386">386</a>]</span>as a matter of fact, that nearly all the
extensive areca plantations in the district are in the hands of either
the Hav&#299;k Brahmins or the Chitp&#257;vans allied much to the
Mahratta Brahmins of Bombay. These plantations are managed by these
Brahmins, and new ones are raised with the aid of a handful of Holeyas,
or often without even such aid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e13962width" id="pl1-387"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">Oriya Br&#257;hman.</p>
</div>
<p><i>VI. Oriya.</i>&mdash;The Oriya Br&#257;hmans of the Ganjam
district belong to the Utkala section of the Pancha Gaudas. Between
them and the Pancha Dr&#257;vidas there is very considerable
difference. None of the sections of the Pancha Dr&#257;vidas adopt the
g&#333;sha system as regards their females, whereas Oriya Br&#257;hman
women are kept g&#333;sha (in seclusion). Occasionally they go out to
bring water, and, if on their way they come across any males, they go
to the side of the road, and turn their backs to the passers-by. It is
noted, in the Manual of the Vizagapatam district, that Oriya
Br&#257;hmans &ldquo;eat many kinds of meat, as pea fowl, s&#257;mbur
(deer), barking deer, pigeons, wild pig, and fish.&rdquo; Fish must be
one of the dishes prepared on festive occasions. As a rule, Oriya
Br&#257;hmans will accept water from a Gaudo (especially a Sullokondia
Gaudo), and sometimes from Gudiyas and Odiyas. Water touched by
Dr&#257;vida Br&#257;hmans is considered by them to be polluted. They
call the Dr&#257;vidas Komma (a corruption of Karma) Br&#257;hmans. The
Oriya Br&#257;hmans are more particular than the Dr&#257;vidas as
regards the madi cloth, which has already been referred to. A cloth
intended for use as a madi cloth is never given to a washerman to be
washed, and it is not worn by the Oriya Br&#257;hmans when they answer
the calls of nature, but removed, and replaced after bathing. Marriage
with a maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter, which is common among the
Dr&#257;vida Br&#257;hmans, would be considered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name="pb387">387</a>]</span>an
act of sacrilege by Oriyas. When an Oriya Br&#257;hman is charged with
being a meat eater, he retorts that it is not nearly so bad as marrying
a mathulakanya (maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter). The marriage
t&#257;li or bottu is dispensed with by Oriya Br&#257;hmans, who, at
marriages, attach great importance to the p&#257;nigrahanam (grasping
the bride&rsquo;s hand) and saptapadi (seven steps). The Oriya
Br&#257;hmans are both Smarthas and Vaishnavas who are generally
Paramarthos or followers of Chaitanya. The god Jagann&#257;tha of Puri
is reverenced by them, and they usually carry about with them some of
the pras&#257;dham (food offered to the god) from Puri. They are
divided into the following twelve sections:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) S&#257;nto (s&#257;m&#257;nta, a chief).</li>
<li>(2) D&#257;nua (gift-taking).</li>
<li>(3) P&#257;dhiya (one who learns the V&#275;das).</li>
<li>(4) S&#257;rua (s&#257;ru, tubers of the arum <i>Colocasia
antiqitorum</i>).</li>
<li>(5) Holua (holo, yoke of a plough).</li>
<li>(6) Bhodri (Bhadriya, an agrah&#257;ram on the Ganges).</li>
<li>(7) B&#257;rua (a small sea-port town).</li>
<li>(8) Deuliya (one who serves in temples).</li>
<li>(9) Kotokiya (kotaka, palace. Those who live in palaces as servants
to zamindars).</li>
<li>(10) S&#257;hu (creditor).</li>
<li>(11) Jh&#257;dua (jungle).</li>
<li>(12) Sodeib&#257;lya (those who follow an ungodly life).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, that &ldquo;the
S&#257;ntos regard themselves as superior to the others, and will not
do pur&#333;hit&rsquo;s work for them, though they will for zamindars.
They are also very scrupulous about the behaviour of their womenkind.
The D&#257;nuas live much by begging, especially at the funerals of
wealthy persons, but both they and the P&#257;dhiyas know the
V&#275;das, and are priests to the zamindars and the higher classes of
S&#363;dras. The S&#257;ruas cultivate the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>&lsquo;yam&rsquo; (<i>Colocasia</i>), and the
Holuas go a step further, and engage in ordinary
cultivation&mdash;actual participation in which is forbidden to
Br&#257;hmans by Manu, as it involves taking the lives of worms and
insects. A few of the S&#257;ruas are qualified to act as
pur&#333;hits, but the Holuas hardly ever are, and they were shown in
the 1891 census to be the most illiterate of all the Br&#257;hmans of
the Presidency. Few of them even perform the Sandhya and Tarpana, which
every Br&#257;hman should scrupulously observe. Yet they are regarded
as ceremonially pure, and are often cooks to the zamindars. Regarding
the sixth class, the Bhodris, a curious legend is related. Bhodri means
a barber, and the ancestor of the sub-division is said to have been the
son of a barber who was brought up at Puri with some S&#257;nto boys,
and so learned much of the V&#275;das and Sh&#257;stras. He left Puri
and went into Jeypore, wearing the thread and passing himself off as a
Br&#257;hman, and eventually married a Br&#257;hman girl, by whom he
got children who also married Br&#257;hmans. At last, however, he was
found out, and taken back to Puri, where he committed suicide. The
Br&#257;hmans said they would treat his children as Br&#257;hmans if a
plant of the sacred tulsi grew on his grave, but, instead of tulsi, a
plant of tobacco appeared there, and so his descendants are Bhodris or
barber Br&#257;hmans, and even Karnams, Gaudos, and Mahantis decline to
accept water at their hands. They cultivate tobacco and
&lsquo;yams,&rsquo; but nevertheless officiate in temples, and are
pur&#333;hits to the lower non-polluting castes. Of the remaining six
divisions, the B&#257;ruas are the only ones who do
pur&#333;hit&rsquo;s work for other castes, and they only officiate for
the lower classes of S&#363;dras. Except the Sodeib&#257;lyas, the
others all perform the Sandhya and Tarpana. Their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name=
"pb389">389</a>]</span>occupations, however, differ considerably. The
B&#257;ruas are p&#363;j&#257;ris in the temples, and physicians. The
Deuliyas are p&#363;j&#257;ris and menials in zamindars&rsquo; houses,
growers of &lsquo;yams,&rsquo; and even day labourers. The Kotokiyas
are household servants to zamindars. The S&#257;hus trade in silk
cloths, grain, etc., and are money-lenders. The Jh&#257;duas are hill
cultivators, and traders with pack-bullocks. The last of the divisions,
the Sodeib&#257;lyas, are menial servants to the zamindars, and work
for daily hire.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>VII. S&#257;rasvat and Konkani.</i>&mdash;Both these classes
belong to the Gauda branch, and speak the Konkani language. The
original habitation of the Konkanis is said to have been the bank of
the Sarasvati, a river well known in early Sanskrit works, but said to
have subsequently lost itself in the sands of the desert, north of
Rajputana. As they do not abstain from fish, the other Br&#257;hmans
among whom they have settled regard them as low. The full name as given
by the Konkanis is Gauda S&#257;rasvata Konkanastha. All the Konkani
Br&#257;hmans found in South Canara are Rig V&#275;dis. Like the
Shivalli Br&#257;hmans, they have numerous exogamous septs, which are
used as titles after their names. For example, Prabhu is a sept, and
Krishna Prabhu the name of an individual. A large majority of the
Konkani Br&#257;hmans are M&#257;dhvas, and their god is
Venkatar&#257;mana of Tirupati, to whom their temples in South Canara
are dedicated. Other Br&#257;hmans do not go to the Konkani temples,
though non-Br&#257;hmans do so. A very striking feature of the Konkani
temples is that the god Venkatar&#257;mana is not represented by an
idol, but by a silver plate with the image of the god embossed on it.
There are three important temples, at Manj&#275;shwar, Mulki, and
Karkal. To these are attached Konkani Br&#257;hmans called <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name=
"pb390">390</a>]</span>Darsanas, or men who get inspired. The Darsana
attached to the Mulki temple comes there daily about 11 <span class=
"sc">A.M.</span> After worship, he is given th&#299;rtham (holy water),
which he drinks. Taking in his hands the pras&#257;dam (offering made
to the god), he comes out, and commences to shiver all over his body
for about ten minutes. The shivering then abates, and a cane and long
strip of deer skin are placed in his hands, with which he lashes
himself on the back, sides, and head. Holy water is given to him, and
the shivering ceases. Those who have come to the temple put questions
to the Darsana, which are answered in Konkani, and translated. He
understands his business thoroughly, and usually recommends the people
to make presents of money or jewels to Venkatar&#257;mana, according to
their means. In 1907, a rich Guzerati merchant, who was doing business
at Mangalore, visited the temple, and consulted the Darsana concerning
the condition of his wife, who was pregnant. The Darsana assured him
that she would be safely delivered of a male child, and made him
promise to present to the temple silver equal in weight to that of his
wife, should the prophecy be realised. The prediction proving true, the
merchant gave silver, sugar-candy, and date fruits, to the required
weight at a cost, it is said, of five thousand rupees. At the
Manj&#275;shwar temple, the Darsana is called the dumb Darsana, as he
gives signs instead of speaking. At a marriage among the Konkanis, for
the N&#257;gavali ceremony eight snakes are made out of rice or wheat
flour by women and the bridal couple. By the side of the pot
representing Siva and Parvati, a mirror is placed. Close to the
N&#257;gavali square, it is customary to draw on the ground the figures
of eight elephants and eight Bairavas in flour.</p>

<p>The following account of the Konkanis is given in the Cochin Census
Report, 1901:&mdash;&ldquo;The Konkanis are a branch of the Sarasvat
sub-division of the Pancha Gaudas. Judged from their well-built
physique, handsome features and fair complexion, they appear to belong
ethnically to the Aryan stock. The community take their name from their
Guru Sarasvata. Trihotrapura, the modern Tirhut in Behar, is claimed as
the original home of the community. According to their tradition,
Parasu R&#257;ma brought ten families, and settled them in villages in
and around Gomantaka, the modern Goa, Panchrakosi, and Kusasthali. When
Goa was conquered by Vijayanagar, they placed themselves under the
protection of the kings of that country. For nearly a quarter of a
century after the conquest of Goa by the Portuguese, they continued
unmolested under the Portuguese Governors. During this period, they
took to a lucrative trade in European goods. With the establishment of
the Inquisition at Goa, and the religious persecution set on foot by
the Portuguese, the community left Goa in voluntary exile. While some
submitted to conversion, others fled to the north and south. Those that
fled to the south settled themselves in Canara and at Calicut.
Receiving a cold reception at the hands of the Zamorin, they proceeded
further south, and placed themselves under the protection of the Rulers
of Cochin and Travancore, where they flourish at the present day. The
Christian converts, who followed in the wake of the first batch of
exiles, have now settled themselves at the important centres of trade
in the State as copper-smiths, and they are driving a very profitable
trade in copper-wares. The Br&#257;hman emigrants are called Konkanis
from the fact of their having emigrated from Konkan. In the earliest
times, they are supposed to have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb392" href="#pb392" name="pb392">392</a>]</span>Saivites, but at
present they are staunch Vaishnavites, being followers of
M&#257;dhav&#257;ch&#257;rya. They are never regarded as on a par with
the other Br&#257;hmans of Southern India. There is no intermarriage or
interdining between them and other Br&#257;hmans. In Cochin they are
mostly traders. Their occupation seems to have been at the bottom of
their being regarded as degraded. They have their own temples, called
Tirumala D&#275;vasw&#257;ms. They are not allowed access to the inner
structure surrounding the chief shrine of the Malay&#257;li Hindu
temples; nor do they in turn allow the Hindus of this coast to enter
corresponding portions of their religious edifices. The Namb&#363;dris
are, however, allowed access even to the interior of the sacred shrine.
All caste disputes are referred to their high priest, the Sw&#257;miyar
of K&#257;si Mutt, who resides at Mancheswaram or Basroor. He is held
in great veneration by the community, and his decisions in matters
religious and social are final. Some of their temples possess extensive
landed estates. Their temple at Cochin is one of the richest in the
whole State. The affairs of the temple are managed by Konkani
Yogakkars, or an elected committee. N&#257;yars and castes above them
do not touch them. Though their women use coloured cloths for their
dress like the women of the East Coast, their mode of dress and
ornaments at once distinguish them from other Br&#257;hman women.
Amongst them there are rich merchants and landholders. Prabhu, Pai,
Shenai, Kini, Mallan, and Vadhyar, are some of the more common titles
borne by them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conclusion, brief mention may be made of several other immigrant
classes. Of these, the D&#275;sasthas are Mar&#257;thi-speaking
Br&#257;hmans, who have adopted some of the customs of the Smartha and
M&#257;dhva <span class="corr" id="xd21e14033" title=
"Source: Carnatacas">Carnatakas</span>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb393" href="#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>with whom
intermarriage is permitted. A special feature of the marriage
ceremonies of the D&#275;sasthas is the worship of
Amb&#257;bhav&#257;ni or Tuljabhav&#257;ni, with the assistance of
Gondala musicians, who sing songs in praise of the deity. The
Chitp&#257;van Br&#257;hmans speak Mar&#257;thi and Konkani. In South
Canara they are, like the Hav&#299;ks, owners of areca palm
plantations. Kar&#257;di Br&#257;hmans, who are also found in South
Canara, are said to have come southward from Karh&#257;d in the Bombay
Presidency. There is a tradition that Parasu R&#257;ma created them
from camel bones.</p>
<p><b>Br&#257;hmani.&mdash;</b>A class of Ambalav&#257;sis. (<i>See</i>
Unni.)</p>
<p><b>Brihaspati V&#257;rada.&mdash;</b>The name, indicating those who
worship their god on Thursday, of a sub-division of Kurubas.</p>
<p><b>Brinj&#257;ri.&mdash;</b>A synonym of Lamb&#257;di.</p>
<p><b>Budubudik&#275;.&mdash;</b>The Budubudik&#275; or Budubudukala
are described in the Mysore Census Report as being &ldquo;gipsy beggars
and fortune-tellers from the Mar&#257;ta country, who pretend to
consult birds and reptiles to predict future events. They are found in
every district of Mysore, but only in small numbers. They use a small
kind of double-headed drum, which is sounded by means of the knotted
ends of strings attached to each side of it. The operator turns it
deftly and quickly from side to side, when a sharp and weird sound is
emitted, having a rude resemblance to the warbling of birds. This is
done in the mornings, when the charlatan soothsayer pretends to have
divined the future fate of the householder by means of the chirping of
birds, etc., in the early dawn. They are generally worshippers of
Hanumantha.&rdquo; The name Budubudik&#275; is derived from the
hour-glass shaped drum, or budbudki. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb394" href="#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span></p>
<p>For the following account of the Budubudukalas, I am indebted to a
recent article<a class="noteref" id="xd21e14060src" href="#xd21e14060"
name="xd21e14060src">113</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;A huge parti-coloured
turban, surmounted by a bunch of feathers, a pair of ragged trousers, a
loose long coat, which is very often out at elbows, and a capacious
wallet underneath his arm, ordinarily constitute the
Budubudukala&rsquo;s dress. Occasionally, if he can afford it, he
indulges in the luxury of wearing a tiger or cheetah (leopard) skin,
which hangs down his back, and contributes to the dignity of his
calling. Add to this an odd assortment of clothes suspended on his left
forearm, and the picture is as grotesque as it can be. He is regarded
as able to predict the future of human beings by the flight and notes
of birds. His predictions are couched in the chant which he recites.
The burden of the chant is invariably stereotyped, and purports to have
been gleaned from the warble of the feathered songsters of the forest.
It prognosticates peace, plenty and prosperity to the house, the birth
of a son to the fair, lotus-eyed house-wife, and worldly advancement to
the master, whose virtues are as countless as the stars, and have the
power to annihilate his enemies. It also holds out a tempting prospect
of coming joy in an unknown shape from an unknown quarter, and
concludes with an appeal for a cloth. If the appeal is successful, well
and good. If not, the Budubudukala has the patience and perseverance to
repeat his visit the next day, the day after that, and so on until, in
sheer disgust, the householder parts with a cloth. The drum, which has
been referred to above as having given the Budubudukala his name, is
not devoid of interest. In appearance it is an instrument of diminutive
size, and is shaped like an hour-glass, to the middle of which is
attached a string with a knot at the end, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>serves as the percutient. Its origin is
enveloped in a myth of which the Budubudukala is naturally very proud,
for it tells him of his divine descent, and invests his vocation with
the halo of sanctity. According to the legend, the primitive
Budubudukala who first adorned the face of the earth was a belated
product of the world&rsquo;s creation. When he was born or rather
evolved, the rest of humankind was already in the field, struggling for
existence. Practically the whole scheme was complete, and, in the
economy of the universe, the Budubudukala found himself one too many.
In this quandary, he appealed to his goddess mother Amba Bhavani, who
took pity upon him, and presented him with her husband the god
Parameswara&rsquo;s drum with the blessing &lsquo;My son, there is
nothing else for you but this. Take it and beg, and you will
prosper.&rsquo; Among beggars, the Budubudukala has constituted himself
a superior beggar, to whom the handful of rice usually doled out is not
acceptable. His demand, in which more often than not he succeeds, is
for clothes of any description, good, bad or indifferent, new or old,
torn or hole. For, in the plenitude of his wisdom, he has realised that
a cloth is a marketable commodity, which, when exchanged for money,
fetches more than the handful of rice. The Budubudukala is continually
on the tramp, and regulates his movements according to the seasons of
the year. As a rule, he pays his visit to the rural parts after the
harvest is gathered, for it is then that the villagers are at their
best, and in a position to handsomely remunerate him for his pains.
But, in whatever corner of the province he may be, as the Dusserah

a &ldquo;sub-caste of Balija. They are sellers of saffron (turmeric),
red powder, combs, etc., and are supposed to have been originally
K&#333;matis.&rdquo; They are described by the Rev. J. Cain as
travelling about selling turmeric, opium, and other goods. According to
the legend, when Kanyakamma threw herself into the fire-pit (<i>see</i>
Kom&#257;ti), they, instead of following her example, presented to her
bukka powder, turmeric, and kunkuma. She directed that they should live
apart from the faithful K&#333;matis, and live by the sale of the
articles which they offered to her.</p>

at Madras for subsequent employment in the Burmese Medical service. At
the Mysore census, 1901, a single Burman was recorded as being engaged

dominions in 1886, there has been emigration to that developing country
from the Madras Presidency on a large scale. The following figures show
